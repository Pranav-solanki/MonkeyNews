      "content": "The British MP said his digital twin will enable constituents to reach him 24/7. Imagine being able to corral your local politician and grill them about their views, anytime you fancy – no appointments, no red tape. That’s exactly what one British Member of Parliament has set out to achieve. Mark Sewards, a Labour Party politician who represents Leeds South West and Morley, has unveiled an artificial intelligence (AI) clone of himself that is designed to answer questions and assist with constituents’ queries around the clock. “I’m very keen to explore how new technologies, such as AI, can help strengthen the connection between an MP’s office and the constituents we serve,” Sewards said in a statement. He encouraged his constituents to “give AI Mark a try” – but noted in an Instagram post that the tool isn’t designed to replace his official duties. Rather, the idea is to provide a 24/7 service where constituents can raise local issues, ask about policy matters, or drop a message to their MP’s office without waiting weeks for a formal reply. The bot “simply gives people another option to contact me, any time of day,” Sewards wrote. How a tech firm cloned Sewards The Leeds-based startup Neural Voice developed Seward’s AI twin, dubbing him the “UK’s first virtual MP”. The company says it uses cutting-edge neural voice synthesis and advanced natural language processing to help create voice AI assistants for phone systems and websites. It used voice recordings of Sewards in parliamentary sessions, social media profiles, and previous correspondences with constituents to create a digital double that mirrors his speaking style, tone, and mannerisms with uncanny accuracy, the company said. It hopes the new technology will make local politicians more accessible to their constituents. \"For too long, politicians have been out of reach for their constituents,” said Jeremy Smith, Neural Voice’s CEO and co-founder. “The vast majority of people do not know the name of their MP, let alone their voice and what they stand for,” Smith added. He believes this technology could soon become par for the course, with other MPs and even businesses potentially following suit in a bid to bridge the communication gap. Digital doubles in politics and business AI is increasingly being deployed in public-facing roles to overcome physical barriers and create constant feedback loops. Last year, the mayor of a Japanese city, Yokosuka, created an AI avatar of himself to improve communication with the thousands of English-speaking US Naval personnel based there. Meanwhile, a political outfit in Denmark called the Synthetic Party created an AI candidate called “Leader Lars” to stand in the country’s 2022 elections, though the party did not win votes. The AI model, which the party says was fed with material from fringe political parties in Denmark dating back to 1970, was designed to engage with citizens who typically do not vote and to demonstrate AI’s role in democracy. Companies in Poland and China have also experimented with having AI CEOs front their brands. Yet such tools can be repurposed to impersonate public figures without their approval, or to generate convincing fake personas that appear to be real public figures. High-profile deepfake scams have targeted Italian defense minister Guido Crosetto , US Secretary of State Marco Rubio , and several celebrities, including Taylor Swift and Joe Rogan, whose voices were used to promote a scam that promised people government funds. Deepfakes were created every five minutes in 2024, according to a report from think tank Entrust Cybersecurity Institute. Whether a digital doppelgänger can truly replace an in-person chat with a public figure remains to be seen, but back in the United Kingdom, Sewards believes it will be at least one promising option. “The AI revolution is happening and we must embrace it or be left behind,” he said on the social media platform X.",

Tex.), which declined to dismiss...The post Alleged \"QAnon John\"'s Libel Lawsuit Against Anti-Defamation League Settles, ADL Removes Page with Accusations appeared first on Reason.com.",
      "content": "I wrote last year about Judge Reed O'Connor's opinion in Sabal v. Anti-Defamation League (N.D. Tex.), which declined to dismiss the lawsuit. Friday, the case settled; the Backgrounder: QAnon page and the Lone Star Report page seems to now have Sabal's name removed, and the Glossary of Extremism and Hate entry for Sabal has apparently been deleted. Here's an excerpt from last year's opinion:Plaintiff John Sabal started his own business, The Patriot Voice, to organize conservative political events. The purpose of these events is to showcase \"pertinent and dynamic speakers, whose messages are timely and relevant.\" These events also \"feature speakers of every color and creed, including those of the Jewish faith.\" ... Sabal contends that ADL defamed him....The first ADL publication at issue is entitled, \"Backgrounder: QAnon\" (the \"Backgrounder\"). The Backgrounder includes two references to Sabal. The first states that \"several aspects of QAnon lore mirror longstanding antisemitic tropes, and multiple QAnon influencers, including ... QAnon John (John Sabal) have been known to peddle antisemitic beliefs.\" [The Backgrounder specifically refers to \"the antisemitic trope of blood libel, the false theory that Jews murder Christian children for ritualistic purposes.\" -EV] The second states that \"[i]n October 2021, several elected officials and candidates spoke at the Patriot Double Down conference hosted in Las Vegas, Nevada by antisemitic QAnon influencer John Sabal (QAnon John).\" The words \"spoke at the Patriot Double Down conference\" link to an article published by the Arizona Mirror reporting on \"some extremely antisemitic imagery,\" such as visuals of Hitler and the Star of David superimposed against a picture of the 9/11 attacks....The second publication is ADL's \"Glossary of Extremism and Hate\" (\"Glossary\"), which \"provides an overview of many of the terms and individuals used by or associated with movements and groups that subscribe to and/or promote extremist or hateful ideologies.\" The Glossary entry at issue here provides that \"John Sabal, also known as 'QAnon John,' is a QAnon influencer who runs The Patriot Voice website, which he uses to advertise QAnon-related conferences. These conferences, the first of which was held in May 2021, have showcased the mainstreaming of QAnon and other conspiracy theories.\" ...The third ADL publication at issue is the report entitled, \"Hate in the Lone Star State: Extremism & Antisemitism in Texas\" (the \"Lone Star Report\"), which \"explore[d] a range of extremist groups and movements operating in Texas and highlights the key extremist and antisemitic trends and incidents in the state in 2021 and 2022.\" The Lone Star Report identifies Sabal in connection with a Dallas conference:Over the last few years, Texas has been at the heart of several notable QAnon events and incidents. The state has been home to multiple QAnon-themed conferences, highlighting the mainstreaming of QAnon and other conspiracies among conservative communities and the GOP. The most notable was \"For God & Country: Patriot Roundup,\" which took place on Memorial Day weekend 2021. Organized by John Sabal, known online as \"QAnon John\" and \"The Patriot Voice,\" the event featured then-Congressman Louie Gohmert (R-TX), then-Texas GOP chair Allen West, Lt. General Michael Flynn, attorney and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell and various QAnon influencers. During the event, Michael Flynn seemingly endorsed a Myanmar-style coup in the U.S., although he has since backtracked on his remarks....The Complaint alleges that the Backgrounder is defamatory by falsely stating that Sabal has been \"known to peddle antisemitic beliefs, including the \"antisemitic trope of blood libel.\" ... From a review of the Backgrounder, the Complaint plausibly contends that a reasonable reader would view the statement \"known to peddle antisemitic beliefs\" as a factual assertion about Sabal. True, some courts have found calling a person \"antisemitic\" to be a non-actionable opinion. However, Texas law makes clear that this determination depends on context, which may reveal that an opinion instead functions as a factual assertion. Bentley v. Bunton (Tex. 2002) (holding that calling someone \"corrupt\" was actionable defamation based on the challenged publication's context because a reasonable reader could view the statement as an assertion of fact). Taking as true the allegations that Sabal has never expressed or endorsed antisemitic views, ADL's statements seem possible to verify: either Sabal has made such statements or he has not, making ADL's assertions capable of being proven false.To accept Defendant's argument that a reasonable viewer would not attribute the blood libel conspiracy to Sabal would require the Court to ignore illustrative context in the Backgrounder. Contextual clues plausibly suggest to a reasonable reader that Sabal factually believes and endorses this antisemitic belief. For instance, the Backgrounder's description of the blood libel conspiracy immediately follows the explicit mention of four \"QAnon influencers\" by name. One of those names is Sabal. ADL identifies these influencers as those who are \"known to peddle antisemitic beliefs.\" The textual proximity of the blood libel theory appears to function as an example of one such antisemitic belief. A reasonable reader could conclude that ADL mentioned Sabal and the other three names to provide examples of people who espouse the specific antisemitic belief of blood libel....The Complaint also plausibly shows that ADL's statements in the Backgrounder carry defamatory impact.... ADL's accusation that Sabal espouses abhorrent beliefs is plausibly harmful to his reputation and occupation—just like calling someone \"corrupt\" in certain contexts carries the same potential harm, Bentley—because such allegations do not carry \"innocent\" meaning....Viewing the entire context—and not merely the individual statements—the Backgrounder implies \"materially true facts from which a defamatory inference can reasonably be drawn.\" ...Sabal's Complaint next alleges that ADL's inclusion of his name as an entry in the Glossary of Extremism is provably false and defamatory because it implies Sabal \"is a dangerous, extremist threat and even a criminal.\" Published by ADL's Center on Extremism, the entry links to a mission statement advising readers that ADL \"track[s] extremist trends, ideologies and groups across the ideological spectrum\" and its \"staff of investigators, analysts, researchers and technical experts strategically monitor, expose and disrupt extremist threats.\"ADL argues that the Glossary entry is not defamatory because it includes entries for many persons beyond Sabal. As such, a description about one person does not necessarily apply to others. But the Glossary has one overarching theme shared by all entries: extremism. The Glossary even states that \"many of the terms and individuals used by or associated with movements and groups that subscribe to and/or promote extremist or hateful ideologies.\" Although ADL contends that calling someone an extremist is not defamatory, the type of extremism featured in the Glossary is of a highly criminal and depraved nature. Combined with the mission statement, the Glossary's context appears convey factual assertions about persons with Glossary entries rather than mere opinion.To a reasonable reader, the Glossary may objectively indicate that all persons on this list are similarly dangerous and abhorrent. In his Complaint, Sabal pleads that Defendant wrongly likened him to \"murderous Islamic terrorists—such as Nidal Hasan, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, and ISIS—notable white supremacists—such as David Duke—and racist mass-murderers—such as Dylann Roof (the Charlestown church shooter), Brenton Tarrant (the Christchurch shooter), and Patrick Cruscius (the El Paso Walmart shooter).\" In the full context of the Glossary, it was plausibly defamatory to call Sabal an extremist by including him alongside obviously dangerous terrorists and mass murderers. Cf. Bentley (holding that, while the term \"corrupt\" is normally used as opinion, it can be used as a statement of fact in certain contexts). Further revealing the plausibility of this defamatory implication is the absence of additional information about Sabal in the Glossary to counter the likelihood that a reasonable reader would understand this publication as a factual assertion about Sabal....Similar to the Glossary and the Backgrounder, the third allegedly defamatory statement is found in the Lone Star Report's reference to Sabal's 2021 \"QAnon-themed\" event when discussing antisemitic incidents, hate crimes, and terrorist activities in Texas. ADL's sole argument is that most of the statements in this publication are not attributable to Sabal. But a contextual review of the entire Lone Star Report tells a different story. By including Sabal alongside antisemites and extremists in a report highlighting \"[h]ate [c]rime [s]tatistics\" and \"[e]xtremist [p]lots and [m]urders,\" a reasonable reader could objectively understand the publication's context as making a factual assertion that Sabal's events are associated with such criminal activity. Further evincing this potential factual imputation is the Lone Star Report's hyperlink to Sabal's Glossary entry. As with the publications discussed above, inclusion of Sabal by name in a report about criminal extremism and antisemitism is \"obviously hurtful to [his] reputation\" in Texas and carries the potential to injure his \"office, profession, or occupation.\"Therefore, the Court determines that Sabal pleads sufficient facts at this stage to show plausible defamation based on the Lone Star Report because it factually implies Sabal is a particular type of extremist who engages in, or is otherwise responsible for, dangerous criminal activity....Looking at each [of the above statements], individually and in context, it is plausible that each is provably false. That is not to preliminarily determine that each statement is, in fact, false. Instead, the Court merely recognizes that evidence could be produced to prove the falsity of the challenged statements, which leads to the conclusion at this stage that they are factual assertions rather than opinion. Similarly, these statements plausibly carry defamatory significance due to the lack of innocent meaning that is hurtful to Sabal's business and reputation. Therefore, the Court concludes at this stage that Sabal plausibly alleges defamation based on statements contained in three of the four ADL publications....The court deferred deciding whether Sabal was a limited-purpose public figure, and thus had to show that the ADL knew that the statements were false or likely false:The requisite degree of fault that flows from Sabal's status is a question of law for the Court to ultimately decide. In candor, this is a close call. And the chaotic state of case law on limited-purpose public figures only further complicates this question. See, e.g., Berisha v. Lawson (2021) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (lamenting that \"the very categories and test this Court invested and instructed lower courts to use in this area—'pervasively famous,' 'limited purpose public figure'—seem increasingly malleable and even archaic when almost anyone can attract some degree of public notoriety in some media segment\"). As a result, the Court determines that it is appropriate to instead evaluate whether Sabal is a limited-purpose public figure at a later stage in these proceedings with the benefit of additional briefing and development of the factual record. Indeed, there are times when \"[i]ssues pertaining to [a plaintiff's] defamation claims are better resolved at the summary judgment stage.\"But the court rejected a separate part of Sabal's claim, which rested on ADL's Congressional testimony, because testimony is absolutely immune from defamation liability.The post Alleged \"QAnon John\"'s Libel Lawsuit Against Anti-Defamation League Settles, ADL Removes Page with Accusations appeared first on Reason.com.",

      "ai_content": "In a significant development within the ongoing discourse around conspiracy theories and online misinformation, former businessman John Sabal—known among certain circles as 'QAnon John'—has successfully concluded a legal battle with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), resulting in the removal of contentious material linked to him from the organization's website. This resolution came after years of litigation initiated by Sabal, who claimed defamatory statements had been made against him through various publications by the ADL.\nSabal began his career as a conservative organizer before launching The Patriot Voice, aiming to bring together diverse voices across different spectrums of belief, including those of the Jewish community. However, he later found himself embroiled in controversy when allegations surfaced regarding his association with anti-Semitic sentiments tied to the QAnon movement—a far-right conspiracy theory that gained traction during President Trump's tenure.\nThe crux of Sabal's lawsuit centered on what he argued were damaging assertions made by the ADL. Specifically, the ADL's 'Backgrounder: QAnon' included claims linking Sabal to antisemitic rhetoric reminiscent of historical prejudices like blood libel—the baseless accusation that Jews commit ritual murders of Christians—and highlighted his involvement in hosting conferences attended by individuals promoting such views.\nAdditionally, the ADL's 'Glossary of Extremism and Hate' featured an entry describing Sabal under the moniker 'QAnon John,' further associating him with extremist activities. In response to the lawsuit and subsequent public pressure, the ADL agreed to remove these materials, effectively distancing itself from direct accusations involving Sabal.\nThis outcome marks another chapter in the complex narrative of how organizations navigate the murky waters between combating harmful conspiracies and avoiding potential defamation lawsuits. While some may view this as a victory for free speech advocates concerned about censorship, others see it as a cautionary tale highlighting the challenges faced by entities dedicated to countering hate and disinformation.",

      "content": "Karol Nawrocki’s inauguration as Poland’s new president on Wednesday has set the stage for a turbulent power struggle with Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s pro-European government and raised fears among Poland’s Ukrainian community. The historian and author used his swearing-in speech to parliament to make his position clear: “No to illegal immigration, no to the euro.” Nawrocki’s election campaign was marked by a rise in nationalist rhetoric and repeated criticism of Ukrainian refugees living in Poland. His victory has unsettled many at home and abroad. His rhetoric is making it easier for people to express anti-Ukrainian views, warned Oleksandr Pestrykov of the Ukrainian House Foundation in Warsaw – calling it a form of social segregation. “Seeing Nawrocki speak in this way, someone who doesn't like Ukrainians but would have been ashamed to say so, can now say it openly,” Pestrykov said. On the campaign trail, Nawrocki described Ukrainian refugees as “ungrateful” and a “burden on society”. His slogan “Poland First, Poles First” came with pledges to give citizens priority in healthcare and education, cut pensions for Ukrainians and restrict benefits to Poles only. Supreme Court confirms validity of Poland's presidential election Calls for unity mask deep divides Despite his hardline message, Nawrocki has also tried to appear as a unifier. In a video released before the inauguration, he urged Poles to “unite” and spoke of “a new chapter in the history of our beloved Poland”. He said he would be an “active president” from the outset, ready to propose laws and push government action. But cooperation with Tusk’s government may prove difficult. The prime minister has already expressed doubts about Nawrocki’s intentions. “I have no doubt that Mr Nawrocki will do everything to annoy us,” Tusk said. He also warned that he would not let the president “demolish” his government. Nawrocki, who has no prior experience in elected office, narrowly defeated liberal candidate Rafal Trzaskowski in the 1 June election. The close result revealed deep divisions in Polish politics. Although the president does not run the government, the role comes with real power – including veto rights and a say in foreign and defence policy. Nawrocki had the backing of former US president Donald Trump during his campaign . But analysts say he lacks international experience. With Ukraine a key issue, this could become a source of friction. From Washington to Warsaw: how MAGA influence is reshaping Europe’s far right Foreign policy split Nawrocki’s support for Ukraine appears conditional, said Jean-Yves Potel, a historian and political scientist. “Nawrocki seems to want to impose conditions on the Ukrainians, particularly regarding Ukraine’s entry into NATO and the European Union. He wants to exert pressure on this issue,” Potel told RFI. Still, he said Tusk remains Poland’s key foreign policy actor. “He is not going to follow Nawrocki,” he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Nawrocki after his win and expressed hope for continued cooperation. Following a phone call between the two, Zelensky said they had agreed to exchange visits and work together on practical matters. He said he was “thankful for the readiness to work together”. Even so, Nawrocki’s remarks about Kyiv’s “lack of gratitude” and his opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine suggest a cooler relationship than under former president Andrzej Duda. The shift could affect Poland’s role in the regional response to Russia’s war. Polish nationalists stage anti-immigration demonstration ahead of polls Abortion deadlock Tensions are also expected to continue in the lead-up to Poland’s next parliamentary elections in 2027. Nawrocki has openly attacked the Tusk government, calling it “the worst in the history of democratic Poland”. One major fault line is abortion. In predominantly Catholic Poland, the procedure is only allowed in cases of severe foetal abnormalities or when the mother’s life is at risk. Tusk wants to relax the law. Nawrocki has said he will block any such move. “He promises to block any law in this direction,” said Potel. “But on the other hand, within Tusk’s coalition, there are Christian Democratic currents that refuse to liberalise abortion.” As a result, no major change may be possible, despite public pressure. Not all observers think the situation will spiral into open conflict. Piotr Trudnowski, from the Klub Jagiellonski think tank , said “both parties should realise that engaging in intense confrontation is obviously not the way forward.” The months ahead will show whether compromise is possible – or whether Poland’s political divide grows deeper under Nawrocki’s presidency.",

Nawrocki, known for his historical expertise rather than political experience, vowed during his parliamentary oath ceremony to oppose 'illegal immigration' and distance himself from the euro currency. His ascent to power followed closely after defeating liberal candidate Rafal Trzaskowski in the recent elections, highlighting profound rifts within Polish politics.\nNawrocki's campaign resonated with nationalist sentiments, often criticizing the presence of Ukrainian refugees in Poland—a group that constitutes a substantial portion of the country's migrant population due to ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe. His controversial statements included labeling these refugees as 'ungrateful' and suggesting they were a societal burden. This rhetoric has reportedly emboldened individuals harboring anti-Ukrainian sentiments, according to Oleksandr Pestrykov of the Ukrainian House Foundation in Warsaw.\nDespite his divisive approach, Nawrocki attempted to project an image of unity through public addresses preceding his inauguration. He called upon Poles to come together under his leadership, promising active governance aimed at legislative proposals and governmental initiatives. However, Prime Minister Tusk voiced serious reservations about Nawrocki's agenda, forewarning him against undermining his own government despite their ideological differences.\nThe newly appointed president faces immediate challenges given the lack of direct executive authority; however, his symbolic status could still exert considerable influence over domestic policies and international relations. As Poland navigates its post-election landscape, observers remain watchful for how Nawrocki's tenure might reshape the nation's socio-political fabric.",

A longtime city council member and a popular pastor will face off to become the next mayor of Detroit in November as the top two vote-getters in Tuesday’s primary contest. Detroit City Council President Mary Sheffield received 50.82% of the vote on Tuesday, while Pastor Solomon Kinloch received the second-highest amount at 17.37%, according to unofficial election results published by the City of Detroit website. November’s general election will decide which of the two will succeed popular three-term Mayor Mike Duggan, who is running as an independent for Michigan’s open governor’s seat in 2026. Sheffield and Kinloch bested a field of seven others, including former police Chief James Craig, former City Council member Saunteel Jenkins and current member Fred Durhal III. Voter turnout was 16.69% out of a total of 518,314 registered voters.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun) If elected, Sheffield would be the first woman to hold the role of Detroit mayor. She was first elected to the City Council in 2013 at age 26 and has been council president since 2022. Her father, Horace Sheffield III, is an activist and pastor of New Destiny Christian Fellowship church. Kinloch has been senior pastor at Triumph Church for about 27 years. The Detroit-based church has more than 40,000 members across a number of campuses. Kinloch was also an autoworker and member of the United Auto Workers union. \"Detroit, we made this moment together,\" Sheffield told supporters at a downtown rooftop venue Tuesday night after easily taking the top spot in the crowded field. \"We claimed it together, and, Detroit, I believe that our best days are ahead of us.\" She said the primary win belongs to every boy or girl told to \"dream small,\" every neighborhood where people feel left behind, every senior who \"paved the way\" and every college student who wants to stay in the city. \"This is our moment,\" she said. Kinloch said that despite Detroit's resurgence, prosperity has not trickled down to enough of its residents. \"Until we reach the whole town, we have not done nearly enough,\" he told supporters Tuesday night before being declared the second highest vote-getter. \"I didn’t enter this race to chase power. I came to serve with a purpose. If we want a city that shines, we cannot ignore what’s in the shadows. If we want Detroit to rise, we cannot celebrate billions in investment downtown, but poverty in the neighborhoods.\" Kinloch also said crime still needs to be addressed. \"It’s time we reckoned with reality, that far too many Detroiters feel left out,\" he said.

The president has said his tariffs policy is pressuring automakers to move investments and onshore production to the U.S., but automakers are facing initial uncertainties regarding the costs of imported auto parts and aluminum and steel. Stellantis, the maker of Jeep and Ram vehicles, has two facilities in Detroit. The automaker said last month that its preliminary estimates showed a $2.68 billion net loss in the first half of the year due to U.S. tariffs and some hefty charges. Dearborn-based Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, reported in June that second-quarter results fell $800 million due to tariffs, but Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company was in daily contact with the White House and expected \"a lot of upside\" longer term as the administration continued tariffs negotiations, Reuters reported. Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – a potential 2028 presidential candidate who often clashed with Trump during his first term – made her second visit to the White House on Tuesday to discuss tariff relief for the state's auto industry. Duggan, who is running for Michigan's governor in 2026 as an independent, led Detroit as it exited the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history and surged back to respectability following decades of economic hardship. The former prosecutor and medical center chief has overseen a massive anti-blight campaign and pushed affordable housing developments across the city. Supporters of Detroit mayoral candidate Mary Sheffield cheer at a campaign watch party Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2025, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun) The next mayor will inherit a city on much firmer footing than the one Duggan was elected to lead in 2013, when an emergency manager installed by the state to oversee the city's flailing finances filed for bankruptcy on its behalf. Perhaps the most visual example of the city's turnaround has been the renovation of the Michigan Central train station. For decades, the massive building just west of downtown symbolized all that was wrong with Detroit. Ford Motor Co. stepped in and bought the old station and adjacent properties. It reopened in 2024 following a six-year, multimillion-dollar renovation that created a hub for mobility projects. Detroit shed or restructured about $7 billion in debt and exited bankruptcy in December 2014. A state-appointed board managed the city’s finances for several years. Detroit has had 12 consecutive years of balanced budgets. Developers have built hundreds of affordable housing units in the city, and more than 25,000 vacant and derelict homes and buildings have been demolished. The next mayor will be under pressure to maintain that progress and continue to keep the city's financial and population growth going. In 2023, the census estimated that Detroit's population rose to 633,218 from 631,366 the previous year. It was the first time the city had shown population growth in decades.

Infamous Democratic donor George Soros and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke are responsible for two major funding groups behind the Texas Democrats fleeing the state to prevent the GOP from voting on a new congressional map. Powered by People (PBP), founded by O'Rourke, has played a major role in supporting the roughly 50 Democrats who departed for New York and Illinois, paying for airfare, lodging, and helping with the $500-per-day fines the lawmakers face for skipping legislative session, the Texas Tribune reported. Meanwhile, the Soros-backed Texas Majority PAC has reportedly been working with national fundraising groups to secure additional funds for the last-ditch delaying tactic. PBP is actively soliciting donations on its website to support the Democratic effort, promising potential donors that \"100% of your donation will go to supporting Texas Democrats in their fight against Trump's power grab.\" The organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Texas Majority PAC also did not immediately respond.

The 2023 legislation imposing the fine stipulates that payment may not be made \"from funds accepted as political contributions.\" Nevertheless, Democrats across the board say they are following the law. Those clued into the fundraising efforts told the Tribune that they are confident they have found a way to legally distribute fundraising to lawmakers. \"Every dime of expense for this effort is being paid for lawfully,\" the Texas House Democratic Caucus told the outlet.

Greg Abbott has already begun a legal process seeking to remove the \"ringleader\" of the derelict Democrats from office. The lawsuit targets State Rep. Gene Wu, chairman of the Texas House Democratic caucus, arguing his effort is violating the state's constitution. \"Representative Wu and the other Texas House Democrats have shown a willful refusal to return, and their absence for an indefinite period of time deprives the House of the quorum needed to meet and conduct business on behalf of Texans,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences.\" The Texas Supreme Court ordered Wu to respond to the lawsuit by Friday. Wu has yet to submit a court filing, but reacted to the press in a statement Tuesday night. \"Let me be unequivocal about my actions and my duty. When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant,\" Wu said.

      "description": "The Lakers locked in Luka Doncic. Now what? NBA insiders examine the moves L.A. can and should make to build its next title team.",
      "content": "When LeBron James signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018, it had been five years since the franchise's last NBA postseason appearance, a drought as antithetical as it gets for a team that prior to that dry spell had only missed the playoffs five times in its 65-year existence. Now, five years removed from its most recent NBA championship -- when James was named Finals MVP and lifted L.A. over the Miami Heat in six games -- Luka Doncic signed a three-year, $165 million maximum contract extension on Saturday. Whereas James was tasked with restoring respectability to the league's glamour outfit, Doncic's goal is to build a sustainable model that contributes to the Lakers' 17 titles. James was 34 when he arrived in Southern California, informing an urgent approach to team building in hopes of maximizing the tail end of his prime. Doncic is only 26, but that doesn't mean he will be patient in L.A.'s quest to construct a contender around him. Doncic made that clear during a dinner in May with Lakers president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick when discussing their future together. \"I don't want to wait,\" Doncic told the table, a source familiar with the conversation told ESPN. \"I had a taste of the Finals. I am getting back there. So, let's do whatever we can now.\" As the NBA embarks on an era of unprecedented parity -- there have been seven different champions in the past seven years -- the question is: Can the Doncic era in L.A., backed by the deep pockets of multibillionaire Mark Walter and a new ownership group, buck that trend? -- Dave McMenamin Jump to a section: How Lakers can build around Luka League insiders on Reaves' future Lakers prepping for summer 2027? LeBron's options: Don't expect trade How the Lakers should build around Luka Common sense holds that two player archetypes fit best next to Doncic, and the stats bear that out. The first is powerful, rim-running centers. Based on on/off data as calculated by xRAPM , Doncic and Dereck Lively II had the third-best impact of any duo among active players when they were teammates with the Dallas Mavericks . Doncic thrives in pick-and-roll situations when he has the option of lobbing to a big. Since he entered the league, Doncic ranks second in assisted dunks per 100 possessions, according to GeniusIQ tracking, behind only draft classmate Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks . The second player type is a knockdown shooter, as Doncic has generated the most corner 3-point attempts of any passer in the NBA throughout his career, according to GeniusIQ. But the Lakers don't have many on their roster. Among members of their projected rotation, Rui Hachimura and backups Jake LaRavia and Dalton Knecht are the only players who have made their corner 3s at an above-average rate over the past five seasons. Editor's Picks Luka Doncic extension: We answer the three biggest questions facing the Lakers 4d Dave McMenamin Grading 50-plus NBA deals, including Chris Boucher to the Celtics 12h Kevin Pelton NBA all-in tiers: What all 30 teams are chasing in 2025-26 2d Tim Bontemps and Kevin Pelton It likely will be easier for the Lakers to find shooters than quality two-way big men in the years to come. The current supply of shooting in the NBA is so great that the skill set is generally available for cheap. For instance, Luke Kennard (fourth in corner 3-point percentage over the past five seasons, minimum 100 attempts) signed a one-year, $11 million deal with the Hawks this summer, Norman Powell (eighth) was traded for a light return and Seth Curry (ninth) is still a free agent. The Lakers probably could acquire players such as Grayson Allen (10th) and Sam Hauser (12th) in trades without too much fuss if they wanted. Trustworthy big men are rarer, and new Lakers center Deandre Ayton is a decent but imperfect fit in the short term. While he was a solid pick-and-roll partner for Chris Paul with the Phoenix Suns , Ayton isn't as vertical an athlete as Lively, and his effort has proved inconsistent. But there are two schools of thought for the long-term future of the Lakers' center position. The first is that the Lakers need a high-caliber big to match Doncic's brilliance, and it could prove challenging for Los Angeles to add an All-Star at that spot. The second, conversely, is that Doncic is so special he can turn any rim runner into a force; Lively, after all, was only a rookie when he and Doncic started making magic together. As for James' fit next to him, Doncic has shown an ability to work with another ball handler of sufficient skill despite James being neither a traditional 3-point marksman nor a rim-running center. Doncic and Kyrie Irving reached the NBA Finals together with the Mavs, while Doncic and Jalen Brunson made it to the Western Conference finals with Dallas even before the latter's superstar breakout with the New York Knicks . -- Zach Kram What league insiders are saying about the Lakers' next steps The most important business of the next few summers has been completed thanks to Doncic signing his extension. But for all the talk about James' future, perhaps the most complicated question moving forward in Los Angeles regards the future of Austin Reaves . The 27-year-old guard has been a developmental success story, going from undrafted free agent to averaging 20.2 points and 5.8 assists last season for the Lakers with a 37% 3-point percentage for his career. But with Reaves set to hit the open market next summer, just how much will it cost to keep him? And does it make sense for the Lakers to pay him? \"I think he will get $30 [million] plus,\" one executive told ESPN, echoing multiple front office sources who were asked about the next deal Reaves could command. The expectation, from both that executive and others, is that Reaves ultimately will return to Los Angeles, which would cement Reaves' role as the long-term running mate next to Doncic in L.A.'s backcourt -- the role once held by Brunson then Irving in Dallas.

Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . But the tenor of those negotiations -- and where Reaves fits in the long-term picture for the Lakers -- could hinge on what happens next spring. Reaves struggled in L.A.'s first-round playoff loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in April, shooting 31.9% from 3-point range on more than nine attempts per game and also committing nearly three turnovers per outing. \"This is a big season for him,\" one Western Conference assistant coach said. \"He'd better bring it in the playoffs, because he's got to be good enough [to pair with Doncic].\" What isn't in doubt is that, as Zach mentioned above, the most sensible way to build around Doncic is to have a combination of a rim-running center and, more importantly, several 3-and-D wings to surround a player who has proved he can optimize those archetypes of players. \"Unless he's going to play without the ball,\" a scout said of Doncic, \"that's how you have to build around him.\" But the Lakers are far from the only team looking for two-way wings, which are the most sought-after commodity in the league. And while L.A. potentially will have lots of cap space -- and up to three first-round picks to use -- that doesn't mean the Lakers will be able to land them. Doncic also needs to be hidden defensively, another complicating factor when building this roster. The Lakers also have up to eight free agents next summer. Will that amount of expiring money become a tool for Pelinka to make upgrades for both this season and beyond? -- Tim Bontemps How the Lakers' cap, draft situations impact their future There is a three-step process in how the Lakers proceed in roster building: Now, next offseason and in 2027. The Lakers are currently in a holding pattern to fill their final roster spot. Because the Lakers used the non-taxpayer midlevel exception on Ayton and LaRavia, they are hard capped at the first apron. And despite having that roster spot available, they are not allowed to sign a 15th player until Jan. 18. However, after prioritizing positional needs -- signing Ayton, LaRavia, Marcus Smart and Jaxson Hayes then extending Doncic -- Pelinka is not done revamping. \"We like the upgrades we were able to make to the roster,\" Pelinka said during the news conference announcing Doncic's extension. \"But by no means are we going to be satisfied. I think every year we're on an infinite cycle to try to improve this team and win championships, and we'll stay committed to that work.\" While the Lakers do have restrictions on what they can trade (James has a no-trade clause, while Ayton, Smart, Hayes and LaRavia cannot be traded until Dec. 15), Hachimura, Maxi Kleber and Gabe Vincent are on expiring contracts that combine for $40 million in 2025-26. Pelinka has been aggressive with his trades, acquiring Anthony Davis in the 2019 offseason then Doncic in February. An obstacle to the next blockbuster, however, could be the Lakers' lack of first-round draft capital. While they are allowed to swap a first-round pick every year except 2027 and 2029, the Lakers have only one tradable first: either in 2031 or 2032. (Their lone tradable second-round pick is not until 2032.) Starting in the 2026 offseason, their tradable firsts increase to two: 2031 and 2033. The futures of Hachimura, Kleber, Vincent and James play a role in how much financial flexibility the Lakers have next offseason. In the scenario that all four players are not on the roster, the Lakers could have $45 million in cap space. That figure includes the free agent hold of Reaves if he were to decline his $14.9 million player option. Ironically, the best free agent in next year's class is James himself. ( Kevin Durant also could be a free agent in the unlikely scenario that no extension is reached with the Houston Rockets .) \"I think the No. 1 thing we have to do there is respect he and his family's decision in terms of how long he's going to play,\" Pelinka said of James' future. 2025 NBA Offseason NBA free agency is in full swing, and ESPN experts are breaking down the biggest signings and trades. • New free agent rankings: Pelton's top 10 • Latest news and buzz | Details for every trade • Pelton's grades: Free agent deals | Trades • NBA insiders: Rumblings across the league • Marks: How 30 teams ace the offseason • Salary cap space, best FA fits for every team An ideal situation is to parlay the expiring contracts into players who can help now and next season, even if that means having no cap space for the first time since 2019. That would put the Lakers in a position to have close to $100 million in cap space in 2027. That is the summer when Giannis Antetokounmpo , Stephen Curry , Nikola Jokic , Karl-Anthony Towns , Donovan Mitchell and former Lakers big man Davis can become free agents. The lure of playing with Doncic, the Los Angeles market, new ownership and cap space could be a fruitful combination. If you want proof, turn the clock back to the summers of 2018 and 2019, when the Lakers had cap space. They were able to sign James in 2018 and reshape their roster the following offseason, trading for Davis, signing Danny Green then bringing back free agents Kentavious Caldwell-Pope , Alex Caruso , JaVale McGee and Rajon Rondo. The Lakers would go on to win their lone championship with James on the roster in 2020. But cap space under the current collective bargaining agreement and trying to outspend the competition come with risks. Because players are allowed to extend for more money, there is no guarantee that any of the All-NBA free agents will ever become available. This summer could have seen Antetokounmpo, Mitchell, Davis, Caruso, Lauri Markkanen , Damian Lillard , Jimmy Butler III , Rudy Gobert , Brandon Ingram , Derrick White and Ivica Zubac become free agents. Instead, each signed long-term extensions. \"The mechanism of the collective bargaining agreement was very clear: We are trying to give incumbent teams an advantage to draft, develop and keep players,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said during summer league. \"Doesn't mean there's no free agency; but in many cases, you have situations where players are electing to stay in those markets. So, I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing.\" That statement does not bode well if the Lakers play the waiting game and rely on cap space alone to reshape their roster around Doncic. -- Bobby Marks The LeBron question: What are his options? Shams Charania joins \"Get Up\" to break down why Luka Doncic opted for a three-year deal with the Lakers instead of a longer contract. As for James, there has been little mention of his future other than a statement released by his longtime agent, Rich Paul, after James opted in to his $52.6 million salary for this season and comments from Pelinka at Doncic's news conference. \"We want to respect his ability to come up with his timetable on that. I think that's really important. But if he had a chance to retire as a Laker, that would be great,\" Pelinka said of James. Retiring as a Laker likely would require James to come back on a one-year contract if the goal is to preserve room in 2027. Because he has a no-trade clause in his contract, James controls his future at least for this season if he were to play on a different team other than the Lakers. In the unlikely scenario that James did ask out, finding the right trade suitor could present a problem. His former team, the Cleveland Cavaliers , is deep in the second apron and is not allowed to aggregate contracts sent out. They also are not allowed to sign James during the regular season if he were to be bought out of his contract. The Mavericks, on the other hand, are below the second apron but would have to trade nearly half of their roster to acquire James. The Golden State Warriors are not pressed against the apron but are top-heavy in contracts, leaving Butler as the sole viable trade candidate. The Knicks do have the $53.1 million salary of Towns, but that would require the Lakers to inherit the $118 million owed to the center after next season. When James does become a free agent next summer, there will be no shortage of teams waiting for him. The crosstown Clippers could have enough money to sign him outright and pair him with Kawhi Leonard . Then there are the championship-caliber teams, Cleveland, New York and Dallas, that only have the veterans minimum exception to offer in free agency. The Warriors would have the non-tax midlevel exception to offer. But remember, James will have earned $584 million on the court after his contract with the Lakers expires. Which begs the question: Does the chance at a fifth championship outweigh another big payday? -- Marks",

With James having recently won the Finals MVP award, the focus shifts to Doncic at age 26, who expressed urgency to succeed in L.A.

      "ai_content": "In a significant move signaling the dawn of a new era for the Los Angeles Lakers, the team solidified its commitment to Luka Doncic through a substantial three-year, $165 million contract extension. This strategic acquisition comes after LeBron James joined forces with the Lakers in 2018, following a long playoff absence for the storied franchise. James brought immediate success, leading the Lakers to victory against the Miami Heat in the 2020 NBA Finals where he earned the Finals MVP honor.\nNow, with James nearing the twilight of his career and Doncic just beginning his journey into stardom, the Lakers find themselves poised to craft a formidable squad capable of contending for multiple championships. At 26, Doncic possesses youthful vigor and ambition, eager to leave his mark on the sport. His assertive statement during a meeting with Lakers executives and head coach J.J. Redick underscores his desire not to delay achieving greatness; he seeks to capitalize on his current momentum.\nThe Lakers' pursuit of excellence is further bolstered by the financial backing of billionaire owner Mark Walter and a fresh leadership team intent on revitalizing the team's fortunes. As the NBA enters an era marked by increased competition and frequent changes in championship victors, the Lakers aim to defy these challenges by leveraging their resources and Doncic's exceptional skills.\nWith Doncic known for excelling in high-pressure scenarios like those faced by James, the Lakers look towards constructing a lineup that maximizes his strengths while addressing potential weaknesses. The synergy between Doncic and LeBron James presents a tantalizing prospect for fans and analysts alike, raising expectations for another golden era in L.A. basketball history.",

      "content": "There are secret Epstein meetings happening, Trump might be about to make Washington into his own personal fiefdom and a new poll reveals exactly how unpopular he and his team are Donald Trump did his best Michael Scott impression yesterday, swanning about on the roof of the White House and accidentally making a particularly unfortunate gesture with his arm. But that was just the start of a particularly newsy day in Washington DC. RFK has been waging war against vaccine manufacturers and researchers again - but remember, that doesn't make him an Anti-vaxxer. And there's a secret meeting happening today at JD Vance's house to discuss what they're going to do about the Epstein files... Meanwhile, there's a mysterious announcement coming later, Trump is mulling the idea of making Washington DC into his own personal fiefdom and we learn exactly how unpopular he and his team are. Get your favourite snack or drink and get comfy. Here's what you need to know. 1. Trump says he wants nukes on the roof - and does an unfortunate arm gesture... Yesterday morning people noticed some commotion on the White House roof. They looked up and there he was, Donald Trump , wandering the tiles with a few protection officers and a handful of hangers-on, surveying the parts of the building he might want to irrevocably alter in his plan to 'renovate' the most iconic building on earth. Reporters shouted up at the President, asking what he was doing up there, and what he wanted to build next. And it was then that two very odd things happened. First, he shouted \"Missiles. Nuclear missiles\" at the gathered reporters on the ground. He then did a mime, which was presumably meant to be a missile being launched, but really just looked like a nazi salute. 2. RFK scraps mRNA Robert F Kennedy announced last night that he was pulling $500 million worth of contracts for developing mRNA vaccines. It comes after RFK's Department of Health and Human Services scrapped $600 million contract with Moderna to develop a vaccine against bird flu . Explaining his decision in a Twitter video, RFK made a series of arguments that have been refuted by scientists - who believe mRNA vaccines are the best way to protect against future pandemics. \"Had we not used lifesaving mRNA vaccines, we would have had millions of more Covid deaths,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University \"This is a bad day for science,\" said Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania told The New York Times. 3. Unpopular. You're gonna be un-pop-u-lar Gallup has done a wonderful poll, asking Americans whether they like or dislike a list of well-known people. Topping the \"like\" list? The Pope, with a whopping +46 net rating. Which is probably fair enough. He's followed by Volodymyr Zelensky on +18, then by Bernie Sanders on +11. They are the only people with a net positive approval rating. Bubbling just under the positive line are Emmanuel Macron (-1) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (-4) - who is one point more net popular than Robert F Kennedy Jr (-5). So let's have a look at the other end of the list... Most unpopular, by quite a margin is Elon Musk (-28). Benjamin Netanyahu is slightly less unpopular, on -23. And then it's a tie for third and fourth place - between Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, who both get -16 ratings. Pete Hegseth is next on -12, before a three-way tie of California Governor Gavin Newsom, Joe Biden and JD Vance all on -11. No members of the Trump administration score higher than -11. But sure, Trump's numbers are through the roof. 4. Epstein 'strategy' meeting A group of senior Trump officials are set to meet at JD Vance's place today, to discuss their future strategy for handling the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. According to CNN, the meeting will include White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Todd Blanche, the Deputy Attorney General who interviewed Ghislaine Maxwell days before she was moved to a cushier prison camp. If you were thinking it's not entirely normal behaviour for senior Justice Department figures, the White House Chief of Staff and the Vice President to have a private meeting to discuss \"strategy\" for a case like this, and that it looks awfully to the public like they might be colluding on a cover-up, you're not wrong. 5. Ghislaine transcripts could be published within weeks Transcripts of prison interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell could be released within weeks. Maxwell, who is serving 20 years in prison on sex trafficking charges linked to her relationship with dead paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was interviewed twice last month by Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche - who used to be Trump's personal lawyer. Last night CNN claimed several senior sources had told them a tape and transcript of the conversation exists - and the administration is discussing whether to release it. \"A final decision has not been made,\" one of the officials is quoted as saying. Two officials are said to have told CNN the release would \"likely be sooner rather than later.\" One said it could be \"several weeks from now.\" 6. And subpoenas have gone out to loads of pople Meanwhile, the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Justice Department yesterday for files in the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein, part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to Trump and other former top officials. The Republican-controlled committee also issued subpoenas for depositions with former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and eight former top law enforcement officials. The committee is also demanding interviews under oath from former attorneys general spanning the last three presidential administrations: Merrick Garland, William Barr, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and Alberto Gonzales. Lawmakers also subpoenaed former FBI directors James Comey and Robert Mueller. But it was Democrats who sparked the move to subpoena the Justice Department for its files on Epstein. They were joined by some Republicans to successfully initiate the subpoena through a subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee. 7. Maxwell opposes release of grand jury records Maxwell's lawyer, to his credit, has a way with words. \"Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Ghislaine Maxwell is not,\" her attorney David Markus wrote in a filing opposing the release of grand jury testimony relating to Epstein, which has been requested by Attorney General Pam Bondi at the apparent request of Donald Trump. \"Whatever interest the public may have in Epstein, that interest cannot justify a broad intrusion into grand jury secrecy in a case where the defendant is alive, her legal options are viable, and her due process rights remain.\" 8. Trump says Maxwell moving prisons is 'not uncommon' Trump last night signed a bill setting up a task force for the 2028 Olympics in LA. But after the order had been signed, and he'd been given a set of medals from the 1932 Olympiad, also held in LA, everyone else filed off the back of the stage, leaving Trump to take questions from the people there. There was a noticeably higher proportion of soft-ball questions than usual, but a couple of proper ones got through. He was asked whether he had anything to do with Ghislaine Maxwell's move to a cushier prison in Texas. He said, of course, that he did not. \"I didn't know about it at all,\" he said. \"I read about it just like you did.\" He quickly added: \"It's not a very uncommon thing.\" To be clear, it absolutely is a very uncommon thing for a sexual offender to be moved to a lower security prison this early in their sentence. 9. For the sake of Big Balls, federalise DC! Trump's scheduled to make \"an announcement\" this evening at around 9.30pm UK time. It's not clear yet what the announcement will be, but there's been some chatter overnight about Trump trying to take over Washington DC, so it could be that. The District, as it's known, is a self-governing region with an elected Mayor and local assembly. Not quite a state, but more autonomous than a city, if that helps. And Trump has been itching to do away with the local governance of the District for ages. Mostly because DC itself is one of the most heavily Democrat voting parts of the country, and he doesn't like that. Last night he issued an ultimatum on Truth Social. \"Crime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control,\" he claimed. It's not, but we'll come back to that later. \"Local \"youths\" and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent Citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released. They are not afraid of Law Enforcement because they know nothing ever happens to them, but it's going to happen now!\" He said the District \"must\" start prosecuting children aged over 14 who commit crimes as adults and \"lock them up for a long time\". And he said if things don't change he would \"federalise\" the city - effectively putting it under, we guess, military direct rule. To make his point, he included a picture of a man, bloodied, sitting on the pavement at night in Washington, claiming this was \"the most recent victim\", who had been \"beaten mercilessly by local thugs.\" We're not going to re-publish the picture, because it's quite unpleasant. But the figure in the photo may look familiar. He is, it turns out, Big Balls - the 19-year-old who Elon Musk hired to be part of his DOGE bully squad. Musk also tweeted about the incident, but didn't name Big Balls. \"A few days ago, a gang of about a dozen young men tried to assault a woman in her car at night in DC,\" he wrote. \"A Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved her. It is time to federalize DC.\" The picture was taken by Marko Elez, a software engineer who was forced to quit DOGE over a racist social media post. \"My friend Big Balls is a hero. I took this photo after Edward protected a young woman from an attempted carjacking by eight thugs near Dupont Circle,” Elez wrote on Twitter. The police report of the incident tells a slightly different tale. The \"young woman\" was Balls' girlfriend. He didn't \"rush to the scene\", it was an attempted carjacking of his car. But the assailants did indeed assault Balls. \"During the assault, an MPD cruiser pulled into the block causing the suspects to flee. Two of the suspects were apprehended by the on-scene officers.\" As for the streets of DC being a lawless wasteland with crime out of control, no. Crime in DC in 2024 was projected to be the lowest in 30 years. Violent crime has dropped by 34%, with homicide dropping by 31% compared to the previous year. Overall crime is down 15%.

Lord Kim Darroch - who was forced to quit in 2019 after he describe Trump's first administration as \"dysfunctional\" and \"inept\" - accused the American leader of turning the \"Oval Office into a reality TV set\". \"He's sort of like a medieval king - that sort of capricious decision-making - than he is like a modern politician where consistency is seen as important,\" he said at the Edinburgh Fringe. \"He doesn't think that's important at all.

      "content": "WASHINGTON: United States President Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday (Aug 5) that Vice President JD Vance is \"most likely\" to secure the Republican party nomination for president in 2028. Trump has avoided naming a preferred successor and said in February that, while Vance was \"very capable\", it was too soon to make such calls. Asked on Tuesday whether Vance was the heir-apparent to his Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, Trump told reporters: \"Well, I think most likely.\" \"In all fairness, he's the vice president,\" he said. The remarks followed speculation that Trump might attempt to defy constitutional limits and seek a third term. \"It's too early, obviously, to talk about it, but certainly he's doing a great job,\" Trump said. \"And he would be probably favoured at this point.\" Trump also floated the idea of Vance teaming up with Secretary of State Marco Rubio to create a formidable Republican ticket. \"I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,\" Trump said. Trump has suggested serving another term several times, despite the US Constitution limiting presidents to two terms. T-shirts emblazoned with \"Trump 2028\" and \"Rewrite the rules\" continue to be sold on Trump's official online store. However, Trump said on CNBC's Squawk Box on Tuesday he would \"probably not\" seek a third term. \"I'd like to,\" he said. \"I'd like to run. I have the best poll numbers I've ever had.\" Trump is the only American president to have been impeached twice - first in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and then in 2021 for inciting an insurrection. He was acquitted by the Senate both times. Vance, a former Marine and lawyer, has taken on a prominent role in the administration, acting as chief domestic policy advocate and key diplomatic envoy. The vice president has suggested that he could run for president in the 2028 election, but only after consulting with Trump. Rubio, a former Florida senator, has likewise risen in stature, becoming the first official since Henry Kissinger to serve as both national security adviser and secretary of state.",

      "ai_content": "During a recent press briefing, U.S. President Donald Trump intimated that Vice President Joe Biden's deputy, JD Vance, stands out as the probable candidate to lead the Republican Party into the 2028 presidential race. In what appears to be a strategic move away from explicitly endorsing a successor, Trump acknowledged Vance's competence yet deemed it premature to confirm him as the future torchbearer of the 'Make America Great Again' campaign. This statement comes amid swirling rumors regarding Trump's ambitions to break the traditional two-term limit set forth by the U.S. Constitution.\nTrump's comments were made against the backdrop of ongoing debates concerning his intentions post-presidency, particularly given his previous assertions suggesting a desire to pursue additional terms. While acknowledging Vance's significant contributions within the current administration—serving as a pivotal figure in domestic policies and international diplomacy—the president refrained from committing to any specific electoral plans.\nAdding fuel to the fire of conjecture, Trump proposed the possibility of Vance joining forces with fellow politician Marco Rubio, who holds dual roles as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State—a position last held by Henry Kissinger—to forge a powerful GOP ticket. Such speculation underscores the dynamic nature of internal party politics leading up to the next major election cycle.\nAmidst this political chess game, Trump's own aspirations remain shrouded in ambiguity; however, he did concede that he harbors no immediate intention of seeking re-election beyond his second term. His track record includes being impeached twice—in 2019 for alleged abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and again in 2021 for purportedly inciting an insurrection—and surviving both trials through Senate acquittals.\nVance himself has publicly entertained thoughts of vying for the presidency in 2028, though he insists on discussing such prospects exclusively with Trump before making any formal declarations. Meanwhile, Rubio continues to ascend politically, having secured influential cabinet positions under Trump's tenure.",

      "content": "Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi was critical of the Supreme Court's observations against Rahul Gandhi. (File: PTI) The Bharatiya Janata Party has decided to move a contempt of court petition against Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra over her criticism of the Supreme Court's observations while granting relief to Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi in a defamation case linked to his remarks on the Indian Army. On Monday, a Supreme Court bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and AG Masih, while staying proceedings in a lower court against the Congress MP, took strong exception to his statement that jawans of the Indian Army were being \"thrashed\" by the Chinese Army during the Galwan clash along the border in Arunachal Pradesh in December 2022. \"How did you get to know that 2,000 square kilometres of Indian territory were occupied by the Chinese? Were you there? Do you have any credible material? Why do you make these statements without any...If you were a true Indian, you would not say all this,\" Justice Datta observed. Reacting to the stern observations by the top court bench, Priyanka rallied behind her brother and argued that Rahul was performing his duty as a leader of the Opposition. \"With due respect to the honourable judges of the Supreme Court, they do not decide who is a true Indian. It is the job of the opposition leader. It is his duty to ask questions and to challenge the government,\" she told reporters on Tuesday.

Survey shows upper hand for NDA, silver lining for R... Rahul Gandhi to host INDIA bloc dinner meeting on August 7, first since Lok Sabha elections The BJP reacted strongly to Priyanka's remarks and claimed she had committed contempt of court by criticizing the Supreme Court's remarks before the media. \"We are going to file a contempt petition against her because she has been making such irresponsible statements without knowing what the court intended to say (to Rahul Gandhi). The petition will be filed by the bar and the lawyers. The public of this country will not tolerate such irresponsible statements,\" BJP MP Manan Kumar Mishra said on Wednesday. BJP I-T cell head Amit Malviya took to social media and said the court should take suo motu cognizance of Priyanka's remarks as it did in the case of BJP MP Nishikant Dubey. \"The law must apply equally to all. The Gandhis cannot be allowed to believe they are above it,\" Malviya said. \"If the Courts won't decide who is national and who is anti-national, then who will? The smug entitlement of the Gandhi family is not just baffling - it reeks of contempt for the judiciary. This brazen defiance is a direct challenge to the authority of the Supreme Court and cannot go unchecked,\" he added. Priyanka, however, wasn't the only Congress leader critical of the top court's observations. On Tuesday, Congress MP Manickam Tagore said the top court's remarks were akin to the \"language used by the political leadership\" currently in power when pressed for answers. Tagore, Congress MP from Tamil Nadu's Virudhunagar, told NDTV that the Supreme Court's observations on Rahul Gandhi on his allegations of Chinese incursion \"gave a wrong message\" and allowed the BJP to create a different impression despite the top court's order being positive for the party. The Congress party later said in a statement that the top court's observations against Rahul Gandhi were \"unwarranted\" and that leaders of the INDIA bloc agreed with the assessment. \"All the leaders of the India parties agreed that the sitting judge has made an extraordinary observation which is unwarranted on the democratic rights of political parties...It is the responsibility of political parties, especially the Leader of Opposition to comment on issues of national interest,\" it said.",

      "ai_content": "In a significant development within India's political landscape, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced its intention to pursue legal action through a contempt of court petition against Congress Member of Parliament Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. This decision comes in direct response to Priyanka's critique of the Supreme Court's observations concerning her brother, Rahul Gandhi, amidst allegations made about the Indian Army's conduct during the Galwan Valley incident with China.\nOn January 20, a bench comprising Justices Dipankar Datta and AG Masih of the Supreme Court expressed disapproval towards Rahul Gandhi's assertions that soldiers of the Indian Army faced brutal treatment at the hands of their Chinese counterparts during clashes near Arunachal Pradesh in December 2022. In particular, Justice Datta questioned how Rahul came into possession of claims involving territorial occupation and demanded evidence supporting his statements.\nPriyanka Gandhi responded assertively to the judiciary's rebuke, emphasizing that it falls under the purview of an Opposition leader to scrutinize governmental actions rather than determining national identity. She contended that questioning and challenging the ruling party is part of democratic responsibility.\nThe controversy escalated when Priyanka publicly echoed her brother's sentiments prior to them reaching judicial scrutiny. Her stance prompted immediate reaction from the BJP, which accused her of undermining the sanctity of the court's authority by disseminating unverified accusations across various media platforms.\nBJP member Manan Kumar Mishra articulated the party's position, asserting that Priyanka's premature dissemination of potentially defamatory statements warranted formal censure via a contempt petition. He underscored the expectation that citizens refrain from engaging in discourse that could be construed as disrespectful toward judicial processes.\nAs tensions mount between different factions within India’s political sphere, this episode underscores the delicate balance between freedom of speech and adherence to institutional decorum. The forthcoming filing of the contempt petition marks another chapter in the ongoing dialogue around accountability and governance in contemporary India.",

      "description": "The nation is marking the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.",
      "content": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. – Facing a sea of state troopers, Charles Mauldin was near the front line of voting rights marchers who strode across the now-infamous Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 1965. The violence that awaited them shocked the nation and galvanized support for the passage of the U.S. Voting Rights Act a few months later. Recommended Videos Wednesday marks the 60th anniversary of the landmark legislation becoming law. Those at the epicenter of the fight for voting rights for Black Americans recalled their memories of the struggle, and expressed fear that those hard-won rights are being eroded. Bloody Sunday in Alabama, 1965 Mauldin was 17 when he joined the ill-fated “Bloody Sunday” march . John Lewis, who became a longtime Georgia congressman, and Hosea Williams were the first pair of marchers. Mauldin was in the third pair. “We had gotten past being afraid at that point. What was happening in Selma and to us was so unjust that we were determined to fight it regardless of the consequences,” Mauldin, now 77, said. The head of the state troopers told them that they were in an illegal gathering and had two minutes to disperse. Williams asked for a moment to pray, Mauldin recalled. Immediately, state troopers in gas masks and helmets, as well as deputies and men on horseback, attacked the marchers — men, women, children. They lashed out with billy clubs and tear gas, with stomping horse hooves and cattle prods. A cause worth dying for Richard Smiley, then 16, was also among the marchers. He stashed candy in his pockets so he would have something to eat in case they went to jail. As they approached the bridge, he saw about 100 white men on horseback. “The only qualification they needed was to hate Blacks,” Smiley said. “Our knees were knocking. We didn’t know whether we were going to get killed. We were afraid but we weren’t going to let fear stop us,” Smiley, 76, recalled. “At that point we would’ve gave up our life for the right to vote. That’s just how important it was.” Selma in 1965 was a “very poor city and a racist city,\" he said. He said there were some “white people in the town that supported our cause, but they couldn’t stand up” because of what would happen to them. Echoes of the past The Voting Rights Act led to sweeping change across the American South as discriminatory voting practices were dismantled and Black voter turnout surged. Democratic President Lyndon Johnson called the act “a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory won on any battlefield,” when he signed it on Aug. 6, 1965. However, both Mauldin and Smiley see echoes of the past in the current political climate. While not as extreme as the policies of the Jim Crow South, Mauldin said there are attacks on the rights of Black and brown voters. “The same struggle we had 61 years ago is the same struggle we had today,” Mauldin said. Some states have enacted laws that make it harder not easier to vote, with voter ID requirements, limits to mail voting and other changes. President Donald Trump and Republican-led states have pushed sweeping rollbacks of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives with Trump declaring he “ended the tyranny” of such programs. The Justice Department, once focused on protecting access to voting, is taking steps to investigate alleged voter fraud and noncitizen voting. The department is joining Alabama in opposing a request to require the state to get future congressional maps precleared for use, calling it “a dramatic intrusion on principles of federalism.” A long, unfinished struggle The fight for voting rights was a long struggle, as is the struggle to maintain those rights, said Hank Sanders, a former state senator who helped organize the annual Bloody Sunday commemoration in Selma. Two weeks after Bloody Sunday, the Rev. Martin Luther King led marchers out on the walk to Montgomery, Alabama, to continue the fight for voting rights. Sanders was among the thousands who completed the last legs of the march and listened as King’s famous words “How long, not long” thundered down over the crowd. “That was a very powerful moment because I left there convinced that it wouldn’t be long before people would have the full voting rights,” Sanders, 82, recalled. He said the reality it would be a longer fight set in the next year when a slate of Black candidates lost in an overwhelmingly Black county The Voting Rights Act for decades required that states with a history of discrimination — including many in the South — get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. The requirement of preclearance effectively went away in 2013 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in a case arising from Alabama, that the provision determining which states are covered was outdated and unconstitutional. That led to a flood of legislation in states impacting voting, Sanders said. “It's no longer a shower, t's a storm,” Sanders said. “I never thought that 50 years later, we’d still be fighting,” Sanders said, “not just to expand voting right but to be able to maintain some of the rights that we had already obtained.”",

      "ai_content": "As America commemorates six decades since the enactment of the pivotal Voting Rights Act of 1965, former participants of the historic Selma marches share poignant recollections of the struggles faced during the quest for equal voting rights. On March 7, 1965, Charles Mauldin stood alongside fellow marchers at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Montgomery, Alabama, facing a formidable force of state troopers intent on dispersing the crowd. This confrontation, known infamously as 'Bloody Sunday,' marked a significant turning point in the civil rights movement.\nJohn Lewis and Hosea Williams emerged from the chaos as early leaders within the ranks of demonstrators seeking justice. At just 17 years old, Mauldin's resolve never wavered despite the imminent threat posed by armed officers clad in gas masks and helmets. Their aggressive tactics included brutal beatings with batons and tear gas attacks, leaving indelible scars upon the community.\nRichard Smiley, another young marcher, recounted hiding sweets amongst his belongings—a small comfort amidst fears of incarceration. His determination mirrored that of many others present; even under the shadow of potential death, they pressed forward toward enfranchisement.\nThe events in Selma catalyzed widespread reform throughout the Southern United States, dismantling systemic barriers erected to disenfranchise black voters. Today, these narratives serve not merely as historical accounts but as stark reminders of the ongoing challenges confronting minority communities in securing fundamental democratic privileges.",

      "content": "A fan video showed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attending Katy Perry’s concert in Montreal. (Video credit: @ridmi/TMX) Katy Perry is rumored to be in a new relationship with former Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. The two were first spotted out having dinner together at Le Violon in Montreal in late July, with an eyewitness telling TMZ the rumored couple had some drinks and could be seen sharing many dishes together. Just a few days later, photos of Trudeau at Perry's concert at Montreal’s Bell Centre were posted on social media, in which the politician could be seen smiling alongside his 16-year-old daughter, Ella-Grace. In other footage from the concert , Trudeau can be seen singing along to Perry's hit song, \"Dark Horse.\" Rumors of their relationship come following news of Perry's breakup with actor Orlando Bloom. The former couple originally dated for a year from 2016 to 2017, later reconnecting in February 2018. After getting engaged in February 2019, they welcomed their daughter Daisy in August 2020 before ultimately calling off their engagement in June 2025. Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau join a long list of celebrities and politicians who have dated. (Getty Images) NEWLY SINGLE KATY PERRY ENJOYS INTIMATE DINNER WITH FORMER CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER DURING WORLD TOUR BREAK Soon after Trudeau and Perry were spotted out together, The Onion shared an Instagram post featuring a fake photo of Bloom and German Chancellor Angela Merkel out to dinner together. \"Just weeks after announcing his split with fiancée Katy Perry, English actor Orlando Bloom was photographed Friday dining with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\" the caption read. \"‘Angela kept Orlando laughing all night—he couldn’t keep his eyes off her!’ said an insider source who spotted the pair sipping wine, slurping oysters, and splitting a decadent piece of chocolate layer cake at a Michelin-starred restaurant.\" The \" Lord of the Rings \" actor seemingly enjoyed the joke, leaving three clapping emojis in the comments section. Perry is not the only star to set her sights on a politician, with some even going on to marry them. Here are some other celebrities who have dated famous politicians. Rosario Dawson and Cory Booker Rosario Dawson and Cory Booker dated from 2019 to 2022. (Photo by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic) After first connecting in early 2018, sparks flew between actress Rosario Dawson and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., w hen they reconnected in early 2019. The two were spotted at a meet and greet with the cast of \"Dear Evan Hanson\" on Broadway. Dawson seemingly confirmed their relationship when questioned by TMZ while at the airport in Washington, D.C., in March 2019, when she told reporters, \"He’s a wonderful human being. It’s good to spend some time together when we can.\" The \"Jane the Virgin\" star would go on to support her partner during his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination throughout 2019 and 2020, later attending the inauguration of former President Joe Biden with him in January 2021. After over two years of dating, however, a source close to the couple confirmed in February 2022 that the two had gone their separate ways. Elizabeth Taylor and John Warner Elizabeth Taylor and John Warner were together from 1976 to 1982. (Photo by Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images) Elizabeth Taylor met her sixth husband, John Warner, in 1976 while on a blind date, and the rest is history. The couple went on to get married just five months after their first date, with Taylor telling Larry King in 2001, \"I thought we would get married, live on the farm, raise horses.\" In the end, however, Warner set his sights on the United States Senate, and with Taylor's support, won a seat in the legislative branch in 1979 as the senator for Virginia. The demands of being a public servant would go on to put a strain on their marriage and, after a 14-month separation, they divorced in 1982.

(Hannah Beier/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Cheryl Hines and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first met in 2006 while on a ski trip, but as they were both married to other people at the time, they didn't start dating until late 2011, later confirming their relationship in 2012. They went on to get engaged in April 2014 and tied the knot later that year in August. Although the couple spent years keeping their relationship private, the two were thrust into the spotlight when RFK Jr. announced in April 2023 that he would be running for president. Hines stood by his side during his campaign for the presidency and again later during his confirmation hearings prior to his appointment as the United States secretary of Health and Human Services.

Hughes has held his position as a Pennsylvania state senator since 1994, and due to both his and Ralph's demanding work schedules, they haven't lived in the same city throughout their marriage. \"First of all, 20 years, keeping this marriage together, you have to be together sometime,\" she told the Philadelphia Inquirer in February 2023. \"Vincent is not able to leave the state the way I can leave the state. In fact, in 20 years of our being together, I'm going to say my husband has maybe been in California, maybe, 25 times. That means I'm in Philadelphia every two weeks.\" Montel Williams and Kamala Harris Montel Williams and Kamala Harris briefly dated. (Photo by Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images) Montel Williams' past relationship with former Vice President Kamala Harris was brought to light in 2019, when photos of the two of them surfaced on social media and rumors about her dating history were perpetuated on X during her bid for the 2020 presidential nomination. \"@KamalaHarris and I briefly dated about 20 years ago when we were both single. So what?\" Williams posted in 2019 in defense of Harris during the 2019 Democratic primary. \"I have great respect for Sen. Harris. I have to wonder if the same stories about her dating history would have been written if she were a male candidate?\" Since breaking things off with Williams, she married Doug Emhoff in 2014. Barbra Streisand and Pierre Trudeau Barbra Streisand and Pierre Trudeau dated for about a year in 1969 and 1970.

Trudeaumania.\" The two ultimately dated for one year, with Streisand writing, \"My brain was in love, but not my body.\" They remained great friends until his death in 2000, writing in her book, \"the world lost a great leader ... and I lost a great friend.\" LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Their alleged romance follows Perry's recent separation from actor Orlando Bloom, adding to the celebrity-politician romance trend.",
      "ai_content": "Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and pop sensation Katy Perry have become subjects of romantic speculation as reports surface about their potential relationship. The connection between the two public figures gained traction when fans noticed Trudeau attending one of Perry's concerts in Montreal, where he appeared to enjoy performing 'Dark Horse' alongside his young daughter, Ella-Grace. Further fueling the rumor mill, photographs surfaced showing Trudeau enjoying time backstage with Perry, leading to widespread discussion online.\nThe duo reportedly dined together at Le Violon in Montreal earlier that month, according to an eyewitness account shared with TMZ. This sighting came shortly after Perry announced her split from fellow celebrity Orlando Bloom, reigniting interest in her personal life amidst these speculations.\nPerry herself began dating Bloom back in 2016, reconnected with him in early 2018, got engaged in February 2019, and eventually gave birth to their daughter Daisy in August 2020.

      "content": "I was born on 24 June 1946, 10 days after the birth of Donald John Trump, 12 days before the birth of George Walker Bush, and 56 days before the birth of William Jefferson Blythe III, whose name was later changed to Bill Clinton. I did not become president. but among my earliest memories is my grandmother, Minnie Reich, telling me that I would become president. I think she was trying to reassure herself that despite my being a runt, fully a head shorter than other little boys, I’d make her proud. When Trump first ran as a candidate for president in 2015, I viewed him as an anomaly, a cartoon caricature of a con man trying to gain political power. He spent most of his life bullying others – employees, contractors, vendors, women, tenants, lawyers, bankers, politicians, producers. He was and is a bully’s bully – vulgar, chaotic, angry, uninformed, impulsive, vindictive. I have seen the harm bullies cause, and I have spent much of my life trying to stop them. I fought schoolyard toughs who teased and harassed me for being short. I was protected by a teenager who subsequently was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan for trying to register Black voters in Mississippi. I marched for civil rights, protested the Vietnam war, and worked to elect Minnesota senator Eugene McCarthy, the anti-war candidate for president. As labor secretary to Bill Clinton, I tried to protect workers who were bullied by employers. I always believed America was not a nation of bullies. We protected the vulnerable, comforted the afflicted, gave refuge to those fleeing violence and persecution, and gave voice to those who otherwise would not be heard. I found these ideals in the declaration of independence, the constitution and the Bill of Rights, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, Emma Lazarus’s poem affixed to the Statue of Liberty, FDR’s second inaugural address, and Martin Luther King Jr’s “free at last” sermon at the 1963 March on Washington. My parents and grandparents espoused these ideals and my teachers expounded them, connecting me with previous generations of Americans and the sacrifices they endured to preserve our democracy and achieve a greater good. Throughout my lifetime I cherished these ideals and hoped to pass them on. When I was secretary of labor, I had an office near the US Capitol from which I had a closeup view of the Capitol building’s large, majestic dome. When I worked late, which was most nights, I’d look up from my desk and see its hulking beauty lit up like a great monument to the idea of American democracy. I was often exhausted, sometimes discouraged, but the sight of that great dome filled me with the sense that I was taking part in something hugely important. It seemed to illuminate everything I was trying to do and vindicate the frustrations I felt, trying but often failing to keep the economic bullies at bay. Yet Trump was elected president in 2016 and then – after losing re-election in 2020 and encouraging a coup and an attack on the US Capitol, on US democracy itself – he was re-elected in 2024. And on 20 January 2025, he took the oath of office for a second time, right under the great dome of the Capitol. I asked myself how a plurality (albeit a razor-thin one) of American voters could possibly choose to put him in the Oval Office again and trust that he would abide by his oath when he betrayed it the first time. There are many explanations, but for me the most convincing began to unfold more than four decades ago when I noticed that most Americans’ incomes were flattening even though the economy continued to grow. Since then, the lion’s share of economic gains has gone to the top. Most Americans, especially those without college degrees, have felt very little improvement in their lives and their jobs have grown less secure. Vast swathes of the country have been abandoned by industry. The basic bargain used to be that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you’d do better, and your children would do even better than you. But since the late 1970s, that bargain has become a sham. The middle class has shrunk. About $50tn has been siphoned from the bottom 90% of Americans to the richest 1%. Many Americans feel frustrated and angry. Trump gave voice to that anger, although he directed it at scapegoats who did nothing to cause it – undocumented workers, the “deep state”, transgender people, “communists” and Democrats . And he did nothing whatsoever to address the underlying cause. In fact, he gave two big tax cuts to the wealthy. Through these years, I watched as other Republican presidents also cut taxes on the wealthy, arguing that the government should allow the so-called “free market” to operate without constraint – perpetuating the “trickle-down” myth that great wealth in the hands of a few will benefit the many as the rich make the nation more productive. But as I came to understand, the “free market” is a misnomer and little or nothing has trickled down. Meanwhile, I watched Democrats abandon the working class. John F Kennedy was the last Democratic president to depend on the votes of working-class Americans while losing the votes of white, college-educated Americans by two to one. Sixty years later, Joe Biden depended on the votes of college-educated Americans while losing the votes of the white working class by two to one. Kamala Harris lost the working class by an even larger margin. I saw Democratic leaders embrace free trade. I witnessed them deregulate finance and allow Wall Street to become a high-stakes casino. I was there when they let big corporations gain enough market power to keep prices and profit margins high. I saw them look away when corporations busted unions and slashed payrolls. I had a front-row seat when they bailed out Wall Street because its gambling addiction threatened to blow up the entire economy, but they never bailed out homeowners who lost everything. I saw them welcome big money into their campaigns and deliver quid pro quos that rigged the market in favor of big corporations and the wealthy. To his credit, Joe Biden redirected the Democratic party back toward its working-class roots, but many of the changes Biden catalyzed were easily reversed. Kamala Harris’s brief, bright campaign had enormous energy but was on a perilously short runway, and she was not able to address why so many Americans were working harder than ever yet still struggling economically. Over the decades, I urged Democratic candidates and lawmakers to tell Americans why their pay continued to be lousy and their jobs less secure: certainly not because of immigrants, the “deep state”, transgender people, “communists” or any other bogeyman, but because of the power of large corporations and the rich to rig the market and siphon off much of the economy’s gains. I asked Democrats to stop doing the bidding of big corporations and the wealthy and instead champion the working class: demand paid family leave, Medicare for all, free public higher education, stronger unions, and higher taxes on great wealth, and create the biggest boom in residential home construction since the second world war. I argued that corporations must share their profits with their workers and limit CEO pay, that stock buybacks should be illegal, that corporate welfare (subsidies and tax credits unrelated to the common good) should be stopped and giant corporations busted up. I warned that widening inequality and the corruption that accompanied it would eventually invite a demagogue who’d exploit the powerlessness and rage of Americans who felt economically bullied. It’s possible that the arguments I’ve made over the decades have been wrong and my warnings alarmist. But they have been based on what I have seen and experienced. And now that the nation has re-elected exactly the kind of demagogue I portended, there is added urgency in reversing the staggering inequalities and legalized bribery that characterize today’s America. I love America and am proud of much that this nation has accomplished over my lifetime. I remain doggedly hopeful about the long-term future. But, undeniably, we and much of the world now face a brutal set of crises, headed by the decline of democracy and deterioration of the rule of law. A previous generation won the second world war and created the most powerful economy and strongest democracy the world had ever seen, populated by the largest and most prosperous middle class in history. My generation and I then failed to create the decent, sustainable and just society that was within our grasp. In this regard, I’m sorry to say, we all came up short.

      "ai_content": "Renowned economist and former Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, shares insights into his personal journey battling bullies since childhood and how it influenced his public service career. Born just ten days following Donald Trump, twelve days prior to George W. Bush, and fifty-six days ahead of Bill Clinton—who would eventually serve as President—the young Reich faced adversity at home when he learned he wouldn't inherit the presidency like some might have hoped.\nReich recounts a poignant memory where his grandmother assured him he'd one day lead the country, perhaps offering solace amidst his physical stature challenges compared to peers. This sense of destiny fueled his resolve to stand against injustice throughout his life.\nWhen Donald Trump announced his presidential candidacy in 2015, Reich initially dismissed him as nothing more than a 'cartoon caricature' of a manipulative figure—a bully turned politician known for mistreating various groups including employees, women, and even fellow Republicans. Reich had long been familiar with such behavior; having endured taunts about his height during school years, witnessing racial intimidation attempts thwarted by tragedy, participating in marches advocating for civil rights, protesting wars abroad, and working within the government to shield workers from employer abuse—all painted a picture of a society grappling with its darker tendencies.\nAs labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, Reich dedicated efforts towards safeguarding workers facing workplace bullying. His belief remained steadfast—that America's core principles enshrined in foundational documents like the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights stood opposed to a culture dominated by aggression and fear-mongering.\nIn reflecting upon these events, Reich underscores the importance of nurturing empathy and championing the marginalized voices often silenced by powerful adversaries. His narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between maintaining democratic ideals versus succumbing to divisive forces.",

      "description": "‘The single largest threat to California’s coast’ may be an Exxon-backed oil company set to restart a pipeline that caused a massive 2015 spill.",
      "content": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus has three words for the nation’s political elite: “Grow a set.” The acclaimed actress is best known for playing iconic women, from Elaine Benes in Seinfeld , to Vice President Selina Meyer in Veep, and diabolical CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the new Avengers movie, Thunderbolts *. Louis-Dreyfus is also a longtime environmental and political activist. She has made it her personal mission to get California Governor Gavin Newsom , President Donald Trump , and every other political leader she can wrangle to understand that oil drilling is for suckers — and protecting our climate and the economies that thrive off of a healthy and sustainable environment is the stuff of true patriotism. It is not always an easy sell. Seated in her Santa Barbara, California, home with her dog Georgie vying for her attention — I fail to ask if he’s named after that George — it is clear that Louis-Dreyfus is pissed off. “The idea of this decrepit pipeline that failed so miserably and catastrophically a decade ago, the idea of that restarting is an impossible thing to contemplate, and it really has to be fought,” she tells me via Zoom. A decade ago, one of the worst oil disasters in California’s history occurred not far from Louis-Dreyfus’ home. On May 19, 2015, a massive, corroded oil pipeline ruptured, releasing 140,000 gallons of heavy crude oil onto Santa Barbara’s Refugio State Beach. Oil poured into one of the most biologically rich areas of the Pacific Ocean, a key habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, sea otters, sharks, and more than 500 fish species. It was carried down the coast past Los Angeles, oiling 150 miles of beaches and coastline. In June 2015, I walked the beach at the Santa Monica pier, 100 miles from Refugio. A fresh line of thick and pungent oil tar balls — some as large as a hand — lined the sand along the tideline, with new oil from the spill deposited with incoming waves. The spill devastated fisheries, tourism, and areas sacred to the native Chumash peoples. Then-Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency, deploying the state’s Attorney General Kamala Harris . Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century The oil came from ExxonMobil’s offshore operations. For 10 years, the people of Santa Barbara have successfully kept ExxonMobil from restarting those operations, including the ruptured pipeline. Resistance has been led by Louis-Dreyfus’ friend and ally, Linda Krop, chief counsel of Santa Barbara’s small but mighty Environmental Defense Center. I first interviewed Krop in 2015 just after the spill. She described watching aghast, the stench nauseating, as thick heavy waves of oil filled the ocean and poured onto Refugio Beach. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” she told me. “It was just devastating.” Last month, Krop and I walked along the same stretch of beach. Children played in the ocean and teenagers took surfing lessons, enjoying a healthy and beautiful shoreline. Krop is committed to keeping it this way. For 10 years, Krop and her allies have beaten ExxonMobil in the state legislature, the federal government, and in court battles stretching all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. “This project is the single largest threat to California’s coast,” Krop tells me.

It is fronted by a new company funded and backed by ExxonMobil — Sable Offshore Oil Corp, which is behaving with what many here describe as a “Trumpian” and “unprecedented” disdain for the law, under the hopeful eyes and dedicated support of the Trump administration. It would be the first newly started oil development off California’s coast in decades, and the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the county. The project could also usher in Trump’s plan to open the entire Pacific coast (and nearly all federal waters) to oil and gas drilling. “President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” Trump’s Interior Department said in a statement last week, crowing that “we’ve turned a decade-long shutdown into a comeback story for Pacific production.” In response to detailed questions, an ExxonMobil spokesperson says that the company completed the sale of these operations with Sable more than a year ago, and passed me off to Sable for additional information. Louis-Dreyfus and Krop are committed to stopping Trump. They are also clear that the final say on Sable’s project ultimately rests not with Trump but with Newsom, who they argue is failing to act. “He has an opportunity right now to do the right thing,” Louis-Dreyfus says of the governor. “This is far from over.” “I will fight for my home” On March 13, Louis-Dreyfus joined legendary actress and activist Jane Fonda for a press conference at the Environmental Defense Center in opposition to Sable’s project. Louis-Dreyfus then addressed a packed house of more than 500 people who filled the La Cumbre Junior High School in Santa Barbara for a town hall on Sable. Louis-Dreyfus and Krop were the final speakers, following presentations by representatives from nine state agencies with jurisdiction over Sable’s project. Krop warmly introduced Louis-Dreyfus as a “local shero” and “a champion of fighting the fossil fuel industry and trying to protect the climate, our way of life, and a clean and healthy environment.” Louis-Dreyfus has a decades-long history of environmental and political activism. For her podcast, Wiser Than Me — just named one of the best podcasts of all time by TIME magazine — she interviews older women, including giants like labor leader Dolores Huerta, conservationist Jane Goodall, and acclaimed marine biologist Sylvia Earle, who are “brimming with the kind of unapologetic attitude and wisdom that only comes with age.” She was a staunch supporter of both Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris’ presidential campaigns against Trump. Last year, she moderated a forum of Democratic women governors and introduced the event as “what J.D. Vance might call a coven of semi-menstruating witches.” But for Louis-Dreyfus, the fight against Sable is uniquely personal. Her husband was born and raised in Santa Barbara, where his family has lived for generations. Her family previously split their time between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, but that was before their L.A. home was destroyed in the Palisades fire early this year. “The climate crisis is obviously real and upon us — it’s not coming, we’re living it right now. That was certainly felt by me during these devastating fires,” Louis-Dreyfus tells me. “Santa Barbara is a paradise worth defending and protecting,” she adds, explaining that the risk of this oil project “is very close to home... and something that is not possible to turn my back on.” Louis-Dreyfus looked resolved as she approached the podium, scanning the sea of bright red T-shirts worn by the project’s opponents reading, “Don’t Enable Sable,” and the hundreds of competing hats emblazoned with Sable’s logo that were worn by the pipeline’s supporters. Confronting the obvious tension in the room, she leaned into the mic, stared down the audience, and said, “I smell a rat.” “I am here because I’m a resident of Santa Barbara County,” she began. “And this project is a rat.” She pulled no punches, describing the pipeline 10 years ago as “crap” and the people responsible for supervising it as irresponsible. “Thankfully, the whole decrepit thing was shut down,” she said. “But now, Sable Oil from Texas is trying to restart the very same, dangerously inadequate pipeline that ruptured. And incredibly, they’re trying to do it with zero environmental review and zero opportunity for public input. That is insane. It makes me furious. I know it makes you furious.” She called the project a catastrophe waiting to happen. As Louis-Dreyfus spoke, the audience erupted in applause and hoots of support, though there were some jeers and boos, too. The Sable supporters then rose and began filing out of the auditorium en masse. Unfazed, she continued on, calling out Sable for ignoring cease-and-desist orders issued by the California Coastal Commission and for behaving as “an incompetent operator trying to grease the wheels of government.” She declared, “We’re not going to let this happen without a fight,” adding: “I will certainly fight for my home.” “Sable Offshore management, employees, contractors, labor and supporters showed up today in good faith to participate in a town hall meeting where only government officials were on the agenda to present,” Sable vice president, Steve Rusch, told the Santa Barbara news outlet Noozhawk . “Project opponents forced the moderators to give them dedicated time to present biased information and smear the project. The opponents’ self-serving fundraiser and rally was not an appropriate use of public resources.” Louis-Dreyfus later tells me that she was surprised when Sable’s supporters walked out on her, and she wishes they’d stayed. “I was speaking truth to power pretty forcefully... and so they got pissed off,” she says. “I felt emboldened by it, to be honest. It was fuel, the good kind of fuel.” Krop says that Louis-Dreyfus’ speech was significant to those in the audience. “You could feel it in the room,” she said. “It was the kind of support people needed to hear.” Boxing Exxon Krop has spent the better part of the last 40 years at the Environmental Defense Center. Working with a team of just 11 full-time staff, she has relentlessly and successfully gone head-to-head against the world’s largest corporations, cutting Exxon off in every effort to restart its Santa Barbara operations, and helping create some of the nation’s most powerful environmental and public health laws as a result. The nation’s first offshore oil drilling began in Santa Barbara in 1896. In 1969, it was also the site of what remains one of the nation’s worst oil disasters, when a blown-out well operated by Union Oil Company released 3 million gallons of oil into the ocean. The Environmental Defense Center was one of many local organizations born in the aftermath to protect the community from fossil fuels . Under the banner “Get Oil Out!” local organizers spawned a wave of activism credited with birthing the national environmental movement and achieving a series of legislative victories, including the federal National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 and the California Coastal Act of 1976. They quickly won a ban on any new offshore oil and gas leasing or drilling in California state waters. In 1982, Congress followed suit, implementing a series of similar moratoria primarily off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Despite Congress and President George W. Bush allowing the federal moratoria to expire in 2008 , no new fossil fuel leases have been granted in state or federal waters outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska in decades due to staunch public opposition. The offshore oil and gas operations taking place today off the Pacific coast — all of which are offshore California — were grandfathered in; they were already underway when the bans and moratoria were imposed and were allowed to continue. “No one ever dreamed that they would still be here today,” Krop tells me. The oil from the existing operations was expected to quickly dry up. Instead, the companies developed new techniques to keep their grandfathered operations running decades longer than anyone anticipated. ExxonMobil signed its first lease for the Santa Ynez Unit offshore Santa Barbara in 1968 and began production in 1981 . Santa Ynez includes three platforms in federal waters named Harmony, Heritage, and Hondo, supported by pipelines that connect the platforms to shore and on to the Los Flores Canyon Processing Plant. ExxonMobil was able to greatly extend the life of its grandfathered platforms using drilling technologies learned from its operations in Russia, according to a 2010 ExxonMobil press release . It achieved “the world’s longest extended-reach well” at Santa Ynez, extending over six miles horizontally and more than 7,000 feet below sea level. Horizontal drilling is a technique used in fracking, using water and chemicals to blast open rock to release oil and gas. ExxonMobil revealed in a 2017 court filing that the Santa Ynez wells also require acid well stimulation treatments to keep producing; acidization uses acid to dissolve the rock. Both techniques release toxic chemicals into the environment that are harmful to humans and wildlife. In 2022, the Environmental Defense Center and the Center for Biological Diversity won a lawsuit , begun nearly a decade earlier, that effectively bans fracking and acidizing from offshore oil and gas wells in the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a plea from ExxonMobil the following year to review the case, allowing the ban to stand. At the time of the 2015 oil spill, ExxonMobil’s oil and gas was carried from the Las Flores Canyon Processing Plant along the Pacific Coast Highway in an underground pipeline that was owned and operated by the Plains All American Pipeline company. When this pipeline ruptured, the oil entered a culvert which carried it directly into the Pacific Ocean and onto Refugio Beach. Federal regulators found that Plains had allowed the pipeline to corrode to such an extent that the thickness was reduced in places from 24 inches to just 1/16 of an inch. California’s then-Attorney General Kamala Harris secured a grand jury indictment of Plains on 46 criminal charges, including four felonies. The Department of Transportation ordered the pipeline shut down, which is how it has remained ever since. Without the pipeline, ExxonMobil had no way to carry its oil to buyers and thus had no way to sell it, forcing the company to also halt production from its offshore oil and gas wells. ExxonMobil spent nearly a decade trying to secure permission to move the oil by truck, ultimately losing (again) to Krop . Companies are also barred from using tankers to move their oil offshore California. During his first administration, Trump tried and failed to open virtually all federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Under pressure from the fossil fuel industry — led by its largest lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute — he’s now trying to do it again . “You cannot make offshore oil safe, and the Trump administration is trying to ramrod more offshore oil down our throats,” Krop tells me. Back in 2018, Krop helped secure state legislation prohibiting California from issuing new leases for any oil or gas-related infrastructure such as pipelines in the state’s coastal waters that would support federal operations, which also cut ExxonMobil off from building new pipelines to carry its oil to shore somewhere else. The state has also taken additional actions against ExxonMobil. In 2023, Newsom sued ExxonMobil along with Chevron, BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, and the American Petroleum Institute, accusing the fossil fuel industry of lying to the public for decades about its products’ central role driving the climate crisis, and demanding payment for the resulting harm. Newsom is also suing ExxonMobil for engaging in a decades-long campaign of deception that caused and exacerbated the global plastics pollution crisis. ExxonMobil is counter- suing California and several environmental organizations for allegedly “engaging in a deliberate smear campaign” by conspiring to defame the company. Not long after the climate suit was launched, ExxonMobil announced its intention to exit California and promptly sold its onshore operations. Ditching its California holdings could potentially shield ExxonMobil from the state attempting to seize Exxon’s assets if California wins its climate suit and if Exxon were to refuse to pay any resulting damages. Announcing its departure meant that Exxon could no longer count the value of its offshore oil and gas leases as part of its reported earnings. In 2023, it had to take a $3.4 billion earnings cut due to its idled Santa Ynez Unit (the entirety of its offshore California holdings). Selling the operations removes this loss from Exxon’s balance sheet. In 2024, Exxon financed the sale of its Santa Ynez operations and all related onshore facilities, including the ruptured pipeline, to Sable Offshore Oil Corporation. Exxon loaned Sable $623 million, nearly the entire amount required to fund the sale. Though the sale is complete, the handover is not. Exxon and Sable are currently suing Santa Barbara County for its refusal to transfer certain permits from Exxon to Sable. But, other than its gas stations, ExxonMobil now has no remaining significant holdings in California. ExxonMobil is likely playing the long game. While the company is for all intents and purposes being forced out of California, it also has an obsequious and acquiescent ally in Trump and his administration, which is simultaneously trying to undermine and undo climate and environmental actions taken by the state. Trump’s efforts are expected to cost American jobs and increase energy prices for consumers , including significantly raising gas prices at the pump. “Exxon’s Designated Operator” “Sable is ruthless, they are absolutely horrible,” Mia Lopez tells me. Lopez is a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, the first human inhabitants of the Central Coast of California. Refugio State Park is located near the original site of the historic Chumash village of Qasil. Just three days before the 2015 oil spill, Lopez was elected chair of her tribe. “It was so devastating, to our land, our sites, the ocean, the artifacts, so many things that were damaged,” Lopez tells me, pain gripping her face. “It affected our relatives in the ocean, so many birds, seals, dolphins, and whales. That’s my community. Those are my relatives. That’s who I became responsible for.” Lopez stepped down as chair in 2021, but explains, “I just realized there’s no way I can ever step away from this fight against the oil.” She has helped lead efforts to hold the companies accountable and keep the projects from reopening ever since. “They have proven from the moment they stepped in that they are untrustworthy. They have blatantly disregarded laws and regulations,” Lopez says of Sable. Sable Offshore Oil Corp. was formed in 2021 by a group of men who have worked together for years heading small oil and gas companies, including companies with ties to the Santa Barbara oil spill. Santa Ynez is Sable’s only operation — and the only operation ever undertaken by the company. James Flores is chairman and CEO (his son is president of the company). Flores’ previous company, Sable Permian Resources, filed for bankruptcy in 2020 (recovering the following year). From 2001 to 2013, Flores served as the chairman and CEO of Plains Resources, Inc., a company formed in 2001 when it broke off from Plains All American Pipeline (the owner and operator of the failed pipeline found guilty of causing the 2015 oil spill). Flores also served as chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, which currently operates several inactive platforms off of Santa Barbara’s coast. Sable is in a race against time: Exxon gave Sable just two years to either pay back its entire loan with interest or give back the assets. “It doesn’t have time to get a whole new pipeline approved and built, so it aggressively pursued restart of the old, corroded pipeline,” Krop explains. “No one thought this pipeline would ever be used again.” Sable immediately set to work, receiving permits from state and federal agencies, but without a key permit from the California Coastal Commission, an independent state regulator established under the California Coastal Act. Sable contends that it does not need the permit; the commission asserts that it does. The two sides are currently fighting it out in court, with a hearing set for October. The commission has issued several cease-and-desist orders, which Sable ignored, and leveled an $18 million fine , the largest in its history, alleging months of illegal violations of the Coastal Act. “This is the first time in the agency’s history that we’ve had a party blatantly ignore a cease-and-desist order,” Cassidy Teufel, deputy director of the California Coastal Commission, said at the March town hall at which Louis-Dreyfus also spoke. “Sable representatives have told us that they’ll only stop if a court makes them.” Louis-Dreyfus sees Sable as following the Trump playbook. “Following the rule of law all of a sudden seems to be up for grabs, and our country is based on rule of law,” she says. Teufel said that Sable has identified more than 100 locations where the pipeline was defective that are within the coastal commission’s auspices. The company brought in heavy equipment to excavate, destroying and disrupting sensitive habitats and protected areas, including federally designated critical habitat for wildlife protected under the Endangered Species Act, and within sensitive stream corridors and wetlands, all without a permit and in apparent violation of the law, he said. Lopez watched in anguish as the work unfolded, taking place 24 hours a day, seven days a week, primarily carried out by hundreds of temporary contractors. Sable has just 161 employees, none of whom are unionized. “They did not have permission to dig in our lands. They did not have permission to dig up our sites. They did it under the cover of darkness. They did it without seeking the proper permits,” she tells me. “I watched them dig, and there was nothing we could do about it.” In response to questions from Rolling Stone , Sable shared a statement from its vice president, Rusch, asserting that the company’s work to “ensure the safe condition of the pipeline” was “fully authorized by coastal development permits” and accusing the commission of exaggerating the project’s impact, “which were de minimis thanks to Sable’s implementation of best management practices.” The company further states that it “implemented several construction best practices to limit impacts” to coastal, biological, and archaeological resources. “The project is supported by employees, small businesses and community leaders like the tribal leader of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation,” Sable spokesperson Alice Walton wrote in the email, attaching a statement written in October by then-tribal chief, Gabriel Dominguez Frausto. Walton did not mention that this statement was promptly voided by the Tribal Council and Frausto was forced to resign, having “overstepped his authority by responding without Tribal Council or membership approval.” In a subsequent letter, the new tribal chief and the Tribal Council stated their “unequivocal opposition” to the project, “and to any further or continued oil development on our homelands and within our coastal waters.” On May 19, the 10-year anniversary of the oil spill, Sable announced that it had restarted production at Santa Ynez, completed its repair program on the onshore pipeline, and expected to “recommence oil sales in July.” A class action lawsuit alleges that Sable committed securities fraud or other unlawful business practices based on these claims, misleading investors to inflate its stock price just before a major stock offering. It cites the California State Lands Commission, which says that Sable conflated offshore well testing with the restart of operations, appearing to “mischaracterize the nature of recent activities, causing significant public confusion and raising questions regarding Sable’s intentions.” In the strongly worded letter , commission chair and Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis accused Sable of a willful disregard for the directives of state regulatory agencies and threatened to withhold its leases, calling the company “Exxon’s designated operator.” A few days later, the Superior Court of Santa Barbara sided with the Coastal Commission and ordered Sable to stop any further coastal work until it obtains the necessary permits. Despite these warnings and several ongoing legal battles, in Sable’s most recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 11, the company said that it continues to produce from the Santa Ynez Unit, anticipates receiving approval to restart the pipeline, and would begin selling oil on August 1 (it has not). Six days after the filing, hedge fund Encompass Capital Advisors announced its purchase of over 5.2 million shares of Sable, representing over 5.2 percent of the company’s stock. In June, BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, reported acquiring over 5 million shares of Sable, representing 5 percent of its stock, according to an SEC filing . Sable has not and cannot restart the pipeline until it receives final approval from state and federal regulators. It did not answer questions from Rolling Stone as to whether it has secured buyers for its oil if the pipeline does restart. Sable has also gone on offense, hiring Exxon’s lobbying firm, Crossroads Strategies , to lobby the federal government and Platinum Advisors to lobby in Sacramento. Platinum’s clients include the California Business Roundtable and the Plastics Industry Association, as well as progressive groups, including the SAG-AFTRA actors union. Krop is suing on several fronts, including charging state regulators with illegally issuing a key waiver to Sable. She and Louis-Dreyfus are also calling on Newsom to put a halt to Sable’s project once and for all. “He has an opportunity right now to do the right thing,” Louis-Dreyfus says. She applauds Newsom’s forceful response when Trump sent the National Guard and Marines into Los Angeles. “I’m hoping that the same speaking-truth-to-power that he exhibited then will now be applied to this fight.” “Silence is the enemy” “The governor’s office could have prevented all of this,” Professor Paasha Mahdavi, Director of the Energy Governance and Political Economy Lab at the University of California in Santa Barbara, tells me. “Newsom’s office could have just killed this upfront.” Governor Newsom declined a request for an interview. In an emailed statement, a Newsom spokesperson says, “While some offshore drilling continues in federal waters under longstanding federal leases, the governor remains unwavering in his commitment: no new offshore drilling — period.” The governor’s office stresses the necessity of allowing the legal and regulatory process to play out. It disputes Sable’s predictions of a rapid completion timeline, instead asserting that any conclusion is likely far off given multiple barriers in the regulatory landscape to Sable restarting the pipeline, including in the coastal commission’s case. Newsom has taken an aggressive stand against Trump, including the administration’s efforts to open all federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Trump’s Department of Transportation has also recently proposed weakening federal oil and gas pipeline safety regulations and speeding up approvals for new pipelines. Many fear that allowing Sable to restart Exxon’s offshore operations will provide Trump with the opening his administration is looking for to assert that Californians support and even condone offshore drilling, and that the door should be open for more. Krop wants Newsom to publicly oppose Sable’s project, citing the risks of another massive oil spill and climate change. She wants him to commit state agencies to conducting environmental reviews and public hearings. “We’re at the tail end of this project potentially being approved and given the green light,” Krop warns. “It’s time for Newsom to act.” Trending Stories Ozzy Osbourne’s Cause of Death Revealed Why Canada Isn’t Sweating Trump’s Mob Tactics How Two Songwriters From K-Pop and Musical Theater Built This Summer’s Surprise Chart Smash Trump on Undocumented Workers: ‘These People’ Do Farm Labor ‘Naturally’ Louis-Dreyfus joined what was likely the largest protest in Santa Barbara’s history in June as more than 10,000 people participated in the No Kings national day of protest against Trump. The mood in Santa Barbara was joyous and defiant as people stood side-by-side in a mile-and-a-half-long line, their backs to the Pacific Ocean, in a visual blockade against Trump. It was one of more than 2,000 actions drawing over 5 million people nationwide. Louis-Dreyfus wants readers to share her belief in activism, and know that when they engage, they can make a difference. “This now is the moment. Do not be silent. Silence is the enemy,” she says.",

      "content": "Texas sparks national battle over gerrymandering The Democratic governors of California, Illinois, and New York threaten to respond to the state’s attempt to widen the Republicans’ advantage in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections A new clash between the two U.S. giants: California Governor Gavin Newsom threatened to play an ace up his sleeve and respond in kind if Texas goes ahead with its plan to approve new electoral maps that could widen the Republicans’ advantage in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Newsom is not alone. The Democratic governors of Illinois and New York have not ruled out similar redesigns of their local legislatures , a practice known as gerrymandering , if the conservative stronghold sticks with the plan devised by Texas Governor Greg Abbott and endorsed by Donald Trump. “They know they’re headed toward a loss of the Congress in 2026. They’re afraid. And they should be,” Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said Tuesday. The politician was accompanied by members of the delegation of about 50 Texas representatives who fled the state for the north to break the quorum in the state Congress, controlled by conservatives. In this way, they bought time for the imminent approval of new electoral maps in five metropolitan districts governed by Democratic legislators. Trump defended the Republicans’ plans in Texas on Tuesday. “I won Texas. I got the highest vote in the history of Texas, as you probably know, and we are entitled to five more seats,” the president said in an interview with CNBC. His response reflected his particular relationship with the truth, as he did receive the most votes, but his margin of victory over Kamala Harris didn’t set a record. In his talk with the progressive-leaning channel, the president underscored an uncomfortable truth about the American system: both parties use redistricting to their advantage. “You notice [the Democratic lawmakers] go to Illinois for safety, but that’s all gerrymandered,” Trump asserted, accusing the Democrats of being “hypocrites.” “They did it to us,” he recalled. Illinois, with nearly 13 million inhabitants, has only three Republican legislators in 17 districts. This represents just 18%, despite Trump winning 44% of the vote in last November’s presidential election. A Princeton University analysis finds that Illinois, which approved new electoral maps in 2021, has one of the most unfair designs in the country, along with Texas and North Carolina. Abbott’s announcement has triggered a response plan in California, the nation’s most populous state, which sends 52 legislators to Washington each election, compared to 38 representatives from Texas. Governor Newsom has acknowledged that the actions in the Texas Congress could trigger a Democratic backlash to win back the members they would lose in conservative territory. California Democrats currently hold 43 seats in the lower chamber at the Capitol. There are only nine Republican congressmen in a state of nearly 40 million people. According to leaked unofficial plans, a group of Democratic Party consultants in California is drawing up the new maps. These would seek to expand their congressional seat capacity from 48 to 52 legislators. Details of this plan would not be known until August 18, the date on which the local congressmen would return to Sacramento, California’s capital, to begin a new term. The redesign is not guaranteed, as the maps must first clear a tight congressional circuit and then be presented to voters in a special election in November of this year. In Texas, where this new standoff originated, Republicans have openly admitted that the maneuver seeks to expand their representation in Congress, where they now hold 25 of 38 seats. Local officials have claimed, however, that the change to the maps is due to the Department of Justice’s decision that five districts in the state could be unconstitutional because they favor a racial minority. District Attorney Harmeet Dhillon threatened legal action if local officials didn’t redraw the maps for Districts 3, 9, 18, 29, and 33. According to the court, these are “coalition” regions where the percentage of Black and Latino residents combined to form a majority, something that could trigger a lawsuit under the Voting Rights Act, the election law, and the Fourteenth Amendment , which guarantees all citizens equal treatment under the law. Critics of the new district design claim it’s a maneuver to disempower ethnic minorities and accuse the Department of Justice of acting without justification, as there are no ongoing lawsuits targeting these districts. The new districts, legal experts warn, could lead to discrimination lawsuits. The five contested districts are located in the metropolitan areas of Dallas, Houston, and Austin, the state capital, as well as on the border with Mexico. They all share a common theme: they are comprised of a diverse cross-section of minorities that make up the state of 31 million people. Although considered a solid conservative stronghold, the districts in the region’s larger Texas cities tend to lean more toward the ideological center or even favor progressive candidates. Districts 28 and 34, held by Democrats Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, respectively, would be redrawn to give Republicans a slight advantage in a Hispanic-majority area. But the victory of Trump’s party candidates is not assured. The president had an excellent showing among the Latino population in South Texas, where he won 12 of the 14 counties in the border area. Six months into the administration, however, many of those who voted for the Republican have vowed never to do so again. At least a third of Latinos who supported Trump in 2024 have stated they will not vote for a Republican in the 2026 midterm elections, according to an Equis poll conducted last month. More than six in 10 of those surveyed have rejected the economic measures adopted by the White House, especially the administration’s unpredictable tariff policy that has impacted the border. Next year’s elections are still a long way off, but Latino voters will be evaluating not only the president’s economic performance but also his immigration policy. Some of the counties Republicans are seeking to redraw, especially in Houston and Dallas, have suffered harassment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents targeting countless Hispanic families. This could backfire on Republican congressmen.

      "ai_content": "In a significant development stirring political tensions across the United States, Democratic governors from California, Illinois, and New York have issued warnings regarding Texas' recent move towards altering electoral district boundaries—a strategy commonly referred to as gerrymandering—intended to bolster Republican representation in Congress during the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. At the heart of this controversy lies Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to endorse such measures, which critics argue unfairly skew congressional outcomes.\nThe situation escalated when California Governor Gavin Newsom declared his readiness to retaliate similarly if Texas proceeds with its controversial plan. Alongside him stand Governors JB Pritzker of Illinois and Kathy Hochul of New York, signaling a possible domino effect among fellow Democratic leaders. 'They know they're heading toward a Congressional loss in 2026,' stated Pritzker, suggesting fear-driven motivations behind the push for redistricting reforms.\nAmidst this backdrop, approximately 50 Texas representatives absconded to northern states like Illinois to prevent a quorum in their own state's legislature, effectively delaying the ratification of the newly drawn maps until after the election cycle had concluded. These actions underscore the deep divisions within party lines concerning fair representation.\nPresident Trump's defense of Texas' approach came through his assertion that his personal triumph in securing the most votes ever recorded in Texas entitles his party to additional congressional seats. However, his claim overlooks the fact that while he indeed received the majority of votes statewide, his win margin does not surpass historical records. Moreover, President Trump pointed fingers back at Democrats, alleging hypocrisy given their past engagement in similar tactics.\nIllinois currently boasts merely three Republican-held legislative districts amidst its vast population base exceeding 13 million people. Despite receiving less than one-fifth of the state's total vote share under Trump's banner, Democrats continue to challenge the fairness of such partisan maneuvers.",

      "content": "A prominent Georgian journalist was convicted Wednesday of slapping a police chief during an anti-government protest and sentenced to two years in prison in a case that was condemned by rights groups as curbing press freedom. Mzia Amaghlobeli, who founded two of Georgia’s independent media outlets, was convicted in the coastal city of Batumi. She was initially charged with assault, an offense that carried a maximum prison sentence of up to seven years, but the judge in the end found her guilty on the lighter charge of resistance, threats or violence against a defender of the public order or other government official. The case is just one of many to draw protests and international criticism in recent months as the ruling Georgian Dream party has been accused of eroding civil society and democratic rights in the South Caucasus nation. Chants of support as verdict was read A visibly gaunt Amaghlobeli, 50, heard the verdict in the Batumi City Court packed with journalists and supporters, while a protest was held outside the courthouse. Sporadic chants of “Free Mzia!” broke out both outside the courthouse and in the courtroom. She was arrested Jan. 12, one of over 50 people taken into custody on criminal charges from a series of demonstrations in the country of 3.7 million. Video shared by Georgian media outlets showed Amaghlobeli striking Police Chief Irakli Dgebuadze. Amaghlobeli said that after she was detained, Dgebuadze spat at her and tried to attack her. Her lawyer told the court she reacted emotionally after getting caught in a stampede, falling, and witnessing the arrest of those close to her. She also said a police investigation was not impartial and she did not receive a fair trial. In a closing statement Monday, Amaghlobeli described chaotic scenes at the protest. “In a completely peaceful setting, the police suddenly appear, create chaos, and surround me with masked officers,\" she said. \"As a result of strong pushes and blows from behind, I fall to the asphalt. Then they trample over me with their feet.” She added that she was abused at the police station after her arrest. She also thanked her colleagues and the activists for their continued resistance, and urged them to fight on. “You must never lose faith in your own capabilities. There is still time. The fight continues— until victory!” she said. Western countries cite intimidation of journalists Amaghlobeli is the founder and manager of investigative news outlet Batumelebi, which covers politics, corruption and human rights in Georgia. She also founded its sister publication, Netgazeti. In a joint statement in January, 14 embassies, including those of France, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K., said Amaghlobeli’s case represented “another worrying example of the intimidation of journalists in Georgia, restricting media freedom and freedom of expression.” Gypsy Guillén Kaiser, advocacy and communications director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, warned that Amaghlobeli’s case was “a sign of the declining environment for press freedom in Georgia and a symbol for the fight between truth and control.” “You have to decide whether you’re going to vilify journalists, criminalize them, and present them as nefarious characters with malicious intent in order to control information, or whether you’re going to have a public that is truly free, freely informed and empowered,” Guillén Kaiser said. “And that is a fundamental question for every country and for Georgia specifically right now.” Leading Georgian officials defended her arrest. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze accused her of seeking to fulfill a “directive” to discredit police but did not provide proof or say who was behind it. “She attempted to discredit the law enforcement structures, to discredit the police, but she received exactly the kind of response such actions deserve,” he said. “Those who are trying to undermine statehood in Georgia are the ones who are upset by this. But this will not succeed — we will defend the interests of our state to the end.” Political unrest since a disputed election Georgia has seen widespread political unrest and protests since its parliamentary election on Oct. 26, which was won by Georgian Dream. Protesters and the country’s opposition declared the result illegitimate amid allegations of vote-rigging aided by Russia. At the time, opposition leaders vowed to boycott sessions of parliament until a new election could be held under international supervision and alleged ballot irregularities were investigated. Nearly all the leaders of Georgia’s pro-Western opposition parties have been jailed for refusing to testify at a parliamentary inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by the government of former President Mikhail Saakashvili, a probe that critics of Georgian Dream say is an act of political revenge. The critics accuse Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the party has denied. It recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Among controversial legislation passed by Georgian Dream is the so-called “ foreign influence law,\" which requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power.” That law later was replaced with one called the Foreign Agent’s Registration Act, under which individuals or organizations considered as “agents of a foreign principal” must register with the government or face penalties, including criminal prosecution and imprisonment. Members of civil society fear that the law’s broad definition of “foreign agent” could be used to label any critical media outlet or nongovernmental organization as acting on behalf of a foreign entity. Many independent news outlets receive grants from abroad to fund their work. “I think that the main goal of the government was to scare us, for us to leave the country or shut down or change profession,” says Mariam Nikuradze, founder of the OC Media outlet. Most journalists still want to stay in the country, she said, and cover what she described as growing authoritarian rule. “Everybody’s being very brave and everybody’s very motivated,” she said.

      "ai_content": "A significant blow to press freedom came yesterday when Mzia Amaghlobeli, a well-known Georgian journalist responsible for establishing several independent media platforms, received a two-year prison sentence following her conviction for physically assaulting a police officer amidst an anti-government demonstration. The incident took place in Batumi's bustling streets where protesters clashed with law enforcement officials. Amaghlobeli faced initial accusations of assault—a crime punishable by up to seven years imprisonment—yet ultimately stood convicted on lesser charges related to resisting or threatening a public servant. This legal action comes amid widespread disapproval from human rights organizations which argue such cases exemplify the growing suppression of free speech within Georgia. As Amaghlobeli listened intently through the glass walls of the crowded Batumi City Court, her fellow citizens expressed solidarity via impassioned cries demanding her release. Arrested earlier in January along with more than fifty others due to participation in various protests across the nation, video footage circulated widely showing Amaghlobeli delivering a punch to Police Chief Irakli Dgebuadze. She recounted feeling provoked upon being apprehended; alleging that Dgebuadze spit at her before attempting physical aggression. Her defense counsel contended that emotional distress led to her reaction post-stampede, coupled with claims of bias and unfair treatment throughout the investigative proceedings. During her final address, Amaghlobeli painted a picture of disorder erupting unexpectedly among demonstrators, resulting in her own injury and subsequent mistreatment at detention facilities.",

      "description": "Dodik's mandate as Bosnian Serb president was revoked due to earlier appeals court verdict that sentenced him to jail.",
      "content": "Dodik’s mandate as Bosnian Serb president was revoked due to an earlier appeals court verdict that sentenced him to jail and banned him from all political activity for six years. Bosnia’s electoral authorities have stripped separatist Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik of his post as president of the Serb entity in Bosnia, Republika Srpska. The formal step follows an earlier appeals court verdict that sentenced him to one year in jail and banned him from all political activity for six years. Recommended Stories A Sarajevo court in February sentenced Dodik for failing to comply with rulings by the international envoy overseeing Bosnia’s 1995 peace accords, following war there in the early nineties. The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) decided to apply the law which lays down that an elected official is automatically forced out of office if sentenced to more than six months in jail, commission member Suad Arnautovic told reporters on Wednesday. The commission’s decision against Milorad Dodik will take effect after an appeals period expires. An early election for president of Bosnia’s autonomous Serb Republic would then be called within 90 days, Arnautovic said. Dodik’s lawyers said they planned to take the case to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. “Surrender and giving up do not exist. Surrender is not an option,” Dodik wrote in a post on X, adding that he pledges to continue his duties as president. ‘Politically motivated’, says Bosnian Serb government On Friday, the appeals court in Bosnia and Herzegovina upheld the February court ruling, which had sentenced Dodik to prison and banned him from political activity. As a result, his mandate as Bosnian Serb president was revoked. Dodik had also rejected the court ruling then and added that he would continue to act as Bosnian Serb president as long as he had the support of the Bosnian Serb parliament. The Bosnian Serb government said it does not accept the court ruling because it is “unconstitutional and politically motivated”. Dodik has received support from international allies, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic as well as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The European Union, meanwhile, said last week that the “verdict is binding and must be respected”. Bosnia is a candidate for EU membership – however, Dodik’s separatist and pro-Russian activities have stalled progress towards this. Dodik has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb entity to join Serbia, prompting the former United States administration to impose sanctions against him and his allies. His separatist threats have stoked fears in Bosnia, particularly among Bosniaks. From 1992 to 1995, war erupted when Bosnian Serbs rebelled against independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a mini-state, aiming to unite it with Serbia. About 100,000 people were killed and millions were displaced. The US-sponsored Dayton Accords ended the war and created two regions in Bosnia, Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation. The regions are largely autonomous but have some joint institutions, including the army, top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia also has a rotating three-member presidency made up of Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats. Dodik has repeatedly clashed with the top international envoy overseeing the peace, Christian Schmidt, and declared his decisions illegal in Republika Srpska.",

His removal comes after defying previous orders related to Bosnia's 1995 peace agreements. The Central Electoral Commission enforced the ban based on laws stipulating officials lose their positions upon receiving such sentences. Dodik plans to appeal to the Constitutional Court, while his Bosnian Serb government deems the ruling unconstitutional and politically driven.",
      "ai_content": "The Central Electoral Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina has officially stripped Milorad Dodik of his position as president of the Serb entity, Republika Srpska, following a significant legal setback. Dodik faced a conviction at an appeals court in February, where he was sentenced to serve time behind bars and subsequently barred from engaging in any form of political activities for half a decade. This decisive action came about due to Dodik's non-compliance with directives issued under the auspices of the international community aimed at maintaining the stability established through the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords.\nDodik's ousting marks another chapter in his contentious relationship with Bosnia's judicial system. In February, a Sarajevo-based tribunal handed down its judgment against Dodik for disregarding mandates set forth during the peace negotiations intended to end the conflict that ravaged the region in the early '90s. The Central Electoral Commission cited legislation mandating automatic forfeiture of office for those convicted beyond a six-month incarceration term when determining Dodik's fate.\nCommissioner Suad Arnautovic confirmed that Dodik's presidency would cease once the stipulated appeals window concluded, triggering preparations for an imminent presidential election within the Serb Republic—a process expected to unfold within three lunar cycles. Despite these developments, Dodik remains resolute; his counsel intends to challenge the verdict before Bosnia's highest constitutional authority.\nIn reaction to the court's determination, Dodik expressed unwavering commitment to his role via social media channels, declaring his refusal to capitulate and vowing to persist in fulfilling his presidential responsibilities until further notice. Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serb administration voiced strong opposition to what it characterizes as an illegitimate and partisan adjudication—an assertion echoed by Dodik's international supporters including Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\nThe European Union reaffirmed its stance, emphasizing adherence to the finality of the court's decree amidst ongoing discussions regarding Bosnia's prospective accession to the bloc. The nation's candidacy status notwithstanding, compliance with regional governance norms stands paramount.",

      "description": "The model metropolis was built into the river’s path. Now, each monsoon delivers the flood it was promised.",
      "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency, Varanasi, was envisioned by the Central government as a model Smart City, with majestic ghats, gleaming alleys, and modern development. But the city could be engulfed in terrifying floods with just a modest spell of rain. Years of construction aimed at developing the Vishwanath Corridor and the Namo Ghat have choked the river and left no place for the floodwaters to go except through Varanasi’s streets and ghats. With the monsoon filling up the Ganga and water flowing above the danger mark, many areas of the city are inundated. Some residents have left their homes to go stay with relatives, while others have taken shelter on their own rooftops—refugees in their own homes. Boats have replaced vehicles in several lanes. The cremation ghats, Manikarnika and Harishchandra, are now under water. Hundreds of temples have shut their doors. Where once the sacred aarti echoed, now there is only silence. Also Read | Ganga asks to be left alone The new ramp and sewage pumping plant being built at Manikarnika are now submerged beneath the floodwaters. Grieving relatives bringing the dead for cremation are left with no option but to take the bodies by boat to the rooftop of the ghat, and are charged Rs.200-300 for the ride. Now, even this sacred place has become a marketplace. Funeral processions stretch all the way into the narrow lanes of the Manikarnika Ghat. Families, soaked in rain and tears, quietly endure this injustice because they have no alternative left. People are asking: when crores were spent in the name of a Smart City, why is there no space left even to cremate the dead? The shortage of wood, the desperate search for pyres, and faith drowned by the floodwaters—this is the tragedy of Kashi. This has been happening almost every monsoon, unravelling the truth of the Smart City. The scenes are the same at Harishchandra Ghat. The activist Rajendra Chaudhary said, “Ambulances holding corpses [are] stalled in the ghat’s alleys, helpless families carrying biers on their heads, and pyres waiting their turn—this sight shakes the very soul of Banaras [Varanasi].” ‘It’s terrifying’ The floodwaters have now reached Ramnagar Fort, Sujabad, Domari, the Maharshi Vedvyas Temple, and the surrounding areas of Varanasi. Temples are closed. Rituals have ceased. Faith is sinking. A tragic outcome of reckless development. Varanasi Municipal Corporation officials quietly admit that while the banks used to flood even before, the mushrooming of concrete structures along them has worsened the situation exponentially. A boat plies through the water-logged streets of Varanasi. | Photo Credit: Vijay Vineet During the construction of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, nearly 30 metres of the Ganga river basin in front of the temple at Lalita Ghat were filled in to build a massive platform. As part of the project, a ramp measuring approximately 100 feet in length and 150 feet in width was extended into the river. An open stage of the corridor was also built near Jalasen Ghat, along with two parallel walls constructed within the riverbed itself. It was at this very spot that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a ceremonial dip in the Ganga during the inauguration of the corridor. While the main structures of the corridor were built above the designated high flood level, the Jalasen Path is now completely submerged. The rising waters of the Ganga have reached levels the corridor’s planners had clearly not accounted for. The Namo Ghat, previously known as Khidkiya Ghat, easily recognisable by the concrete sculptures of hands raised in the “namaste” gesture, is now nearly overwhelmed. Only parts of the hands are visible, as if Varanasi is begging the Ganga for forgiveness. In Lanka, Saket Nagar, Batuapur, and Kashipur, the sewers are now overflowing. Floodwaters from the Varuna River have reached Uchwa, Dhobi Ghat, Meera Ghat, Chauka Ghat, Dhelwaria, and Shailputri—areas that house over a dozen ancient temples. Water now covers the feet of the idols in these temples, and in place of lamps, there is only darkness. Ganga-jal, once revered, is now feared. Kanwariyas wade through a flooded Varanasi. | Photo Credit: Vijay Vineet The road leading from Assi Ghat to Nagwa has now been shut. The flood has become a great leveller, as residents of posh colonies have also had to leave their homes in areas near Samneghat, such as Maruti Nagar, Gayatri Nagar, Patel Nagar, Vishwas Nagar, Hari Om Nagar, Ratnakar Vihar, and Krishnapuri Colony. The ground floors of houses along the Varuna Corridor are now under water. The steps of the ghats have disappeared into the Ganga, and now all that remains of the ghats is an expanse of water. In Maruti Nagar, Nagwa, where thousands of buildings were constructed in flood-prone areas, the water has reached the foundations of these structures, and the administration has finally woken up. Varanasi Divisional Commissioner S. Rajalingam has been repeatedly saying that “all illegal constructions within the Ganga basin area will be sealed”. He reiterated the same statement during last year’s floods as well, but his warning no longer holds any significance for the affected residents. About three months ago, the Uttar Pradesh government appointed Rajalingam as the Commissioner of Varanasi. He had earlier served as the District Magistrate of the city. At present, he also holds the position of Chairman of the Varanasi Development Authority. The flood takes it all According to Varanasi District Magistrate Satyendra Kumar, “There is a well-coordinated system in place to deal with the floods in Varanasi. Flood relief centres have been opened..., boats have been arranged..., the water police are working with motorboats, and housing arrangements for 1,500 people have been made in 14 relief camps. The administration is fully alert.” But the ground reality is grave. As water entered homes in areas like Dhelwaria, Koniya, Samne Ghat, Domari, Nagwa, Ramna, Banpurwa, Shooltankeshwar, Phulwaria, Nakkhighat, Suarbarwa, Saraiya, Koniya, Pul Kohna, Baghwa Nala, Sona Talab, Salarpur, and Sarai Mohana, people moved out carrying what they could. Some have left what remains of their possessions in the care of others and are now camped out on rooftops. Saddam, a weaver from Saraiya, said, “Where water hasn’t reached, snakes and scorpions have. The rotting carcasses of livestock from the Varuna are now floating into [our] neighbourhoods. The stench [is unbearable]. The homes where stoves once burned are now filled with fear. Children are suffering the most. Tiffin boxes are empty, and schoolbooks are soaked.” A structure of the Inland Waterways Authority submerged by the flooding Ganga. | Photo Credit: Vijay Vineet In Salarpur, Koniya, Saraiya, and Nazeerpura neighbourhoods where many weavers live, the looms have fallen silent. The homes of Junaid and Mumtaz are on the verge of being swallowed by the floodwaters. Jameel Ahmad, a weaver, said, “The loom is shut, there’s no income.” Talib adds, “Many children living near the Varuna have had to drop out of school. Now the worry is about every single grain of food.” Haseen Ahmad, a sari businessman, recalls, “Floods like this happened in 2013, 2016, and 2019 too. Each time, the same crisis, the same loss. The saris on the loom turned black. This time there’s a little relief, but the pain hasn’t lessened. Work is stalled, and our stomachs are empty.” In the flood relief camp set up at Saraiya primary school, many families have taken refuge, including those of Roshan Jahan and Jaitun Bibi from the Jalal Baba neighbourhood. Roshan said, “We’re getting food at the relief camp, but the house that was swept away will never come back.” There is also concern about hygiene and sanitation. “There’s so much filth that diseases have begun to emerge,” he said. At Nakkhi Ghat in Banaras, floodwaters have silenced the looms of countless weavers, forcing families to flee to safer ground. | Photo Credit: Vijay Vineet Farzana, who used to work at Chanda Sarees, affixing sequins to fabric, has lost her home and now lives in the camp. She said, “The markets are shut. There’s no money. There’s no work. Whatever we earn goes into medical treatment. Every year, the flood comes. Every year, we are abandoned. This year is no different.” Among those taking shelter in the relief camps are Neha, Akbar, Aminuddin, Mohammad Kareem, Mohammad Aslam, and a few women. They said the situation in the Saraiya camp is “somewhat better”. “In our neighbourhoods, many are still living on their rooftops.” The flood damage is not limited to the city—it has devastated rural areas too. From Pindra, Koirajpur, Chamav, Gosainpur, Dhab Island, and Rameshwar, all the way to Sattanpur, crops in hundreds of acres are rotting under water. Dhab Island, once a peaceful isle nestled in the lap of the Ganga, is now completely cut off. Rajendra Singh, head of Mustafabad village, said, “The lands of Mokalpur, Gobarha, and Rampur are washed away every year. It’s the same this time, too. But no one comes to ask. The administration sends boats, but who will return our crops, our future?” Where are the sustainable solutions? The journalist Rishi Jhingran pointed out that distributing food to flood victims or giving them bedding in relief camps isn’t a real solution. “First, we need to understand why the Ganga is swelling... every three to four years? The root lies in the countless violations committed against [the river],” he said. Over the past eight years, the Ganga has been treated like a stagnant drain where sand could be dumped at will, and dredging carried out indiscriminately, obstructing the river’s flow and diverting its natural path, he added. The journalist Suresh Pratap Singh, who wrote about the Modi-Yogi (Adityanath) regime’s actions during the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor construction in his book Udta Banaras , has posted on his Facebook wall: “What was done at Lalita Ghat—the arbitrary construction, the forest of stone and concrete—that is a direct assault on the soul of Ganga. Today, as the Ganga rages and rises even above Lalita Ghat, it is less a divine wrath than the result of human error and the BJP government’s stubbornness.” Vinay Maurya Sinner, editor of the weekly Achook Rananeeti published from Varanasi, noted that after the 1978 flood, the areas that should have been left uninhabited were instead turned into colonies. “Today, those very settlements are the worst victims of the Ganga’s fury.” He said the government’s development activities are shutting down natural drainage paths. “Till date, the government has failed to create a reliable water drainage system in Banaras. Where water never collected before, now there’s waterlogging. This is the failure of the system. Haphazard constructions and neglect of basic infrastructure have turned a historic city like Banaras into a swamp.” The advocate Saurabh Tiwari, who has filed several public interest litigations concerning the Ganga with the National Green Tribunal—the statutory body dealing with cases relating to the environmental protection—said, “Dumping debris in the sacred Ganga and [carrying out] unscientific construction in the name of developing the ghats has altered the river’s natural flow.” In flooded Varanasi, temple idols barely remain above water as the rising Ganga swallows centuries-old places of worship. | Photo Credit: Vijay Vineet The advocate Ashish Pathak, a vocal voice for cleaning the Ganga, said, “In the last four to five years, nearly 60,000 truckloads of debris have been dumped into the Ganga. The river’s capacity has decreased, the depth along its banks has been reduced, and the sewer outflows are blocked. The way the design of the ghats has been changed, the way concrete jungles have been raised, it has severely disrupted Ganga’s natural movement. If we still don’t wake up, future generations will read about Ganga [only] in books, they won’t be able to bathe in her waters.” The administration continues to portray the situation as “normal”, but for those who have lost their homes, this is nothing but an apocalypse. The floods in Varanasi have once again exposed the truth behind the so-called Smart City touted for years by Modi and Uttar Pradesh’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Commenting on the catastrophe, Chandauli MP Virendra Singh asked, “Is this Kyoto? Was this the future that was promised to the people of Banaras?” (In August 2014, Modi had signed an agreement with his then Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe to transform Varanasi into a Kyoto-style smart city. Kyoto, a pilgrimage destination called the city of 10,000 shrines, also has a river flowing through it.) Virendra Singh, a Samajwadi Party MP who recently returned after conducting a study on Kyoto, questioned the BJP government’s hollow development claims, saying, “Over Rs.850 crore was spent building roads in Banaras. Grand claims were made in the name of the smart city. But with the rains, the same roads collapsed, the sewers overflowed, and the alleys were filled with mud and stench. The Narendra Modi whom Banaras called from Gujarat and sent to Parliament three times, was he chosen so that the city could drown and development remain confined to papers?” He said that Modi had claimed that he could feel the soul of Varanasi, but all that is palpable now is the stench of fear and disease in the city’s alleys. “Over the past decade, people have borne the weight of these false dreams. The people of Banaras hoped to have a city like Kyoto, but what they got was filthy floodwater from the rising Ganga, neighbourhoods devastated by waterlogging, closed schools, drowning hospitals, and a city grappling with traffic chaos. When the people of Banaras raise their voice against soaring tomato prices, they’re sent to jail, but complaints about corruption and mismanagement find no ears.” Congress city unit president Raghvendra Chaubey feels Varanasi has everything, except compassion. He said, “People now no longer stand on the banks of Ganga for darshan—they search for direction, asking how to escape this flood. And the real question is, if this is development, then what will we call destruction? Ganga is not just a river. She is our cultural, spiritual, and ecological heritage.” The floodwaters that have settled through Banaras reflect the truth that governments often try to conceal. Forget becoming Kyoto—what the city desperately needs is basic amenities. But what was done in the name of development is neither solid nor sustainable. Experts weigh in Professor B.D. Tripathi, Chairman of the Mahamana Malaviya Ganga Research Centre at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), feels that the Ganga no longer carries the life-giving energy that once sanctified the ghats of Kashi (Banaras-Anandvan). He said, “The Ganga has become much shallower compared to earlier times. During the construction of the Vishwanath Corridor, construction materials and debris were dumped into the river basin. As a result, sand began to accumulate in the Ganga’s basin. When the river became shallow, its water-absorbing capacity also declined. Now, just a few hours of rainfall are enough to submerge the alleys, and the Ganga takes on a fierce form.” Prof. Tripathi called attention to the issue with the modern sewerage systems in the city. “In the name of the Smart City, traditional drainage systems were either shut down or ignored. The current drainage system does not meet the needs of this historic city. Sewer lines are broken [and] gutters are overflowing.” Prof. Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, who teaches at the Department of Electronics Engineering in IIT-BHU and among the country’s foremost river experts, is also the Mahant of the Sankat Mochan Temple. He said: “Earlier, the Ganga would come and stop at the city’s doorstep. Now, it has entered the city’s kitchen, [bringing] along the sewage. This is not a flood, it is the peak of our policy-level foolishness and arrogance.... In the name of development, the traditional systems that protected us from floods for centuries have been dismantled.” The concrete hands at Namo Ghat barely rise above the floodwaters. | Photo Credit: Vijay Vineet Prof. Mishra said, “When the Namo Ghat was built, that area was a region of riverbank erosion. A canal was made there, cutting off the Ganga’s natural flow. Laying concrete on the river’s edges without understanding its current, imprisoning its natural flow within walls-all of this [feels] like a conspiracy to slowly destroy the Ganga.” He said the Vishwanath Corridor was constructed by encroaching 30 metres into the river, filling it with sand. “Today, a mound of sand stands at Assi Ghat. A similar mound will soon appear between Dashashwamedh and Lalita Ghat, which will in the future become the cause for more erosion and destruction. The speed of the river is not being understood. Reckless construction is underway. Work is happening without any clear plan. In areas like Ravindrapuri, pipelines have been laid three times. To this day, it’s unclear what the experiment is and why it’s being done,” he added. According to a recent report by the Sankat Mochan Foundation: “In the summer of 1996, the depth of the Ganga used to be 12 metres; now it is only six metres... Its expanse has also shrunk. In summers, where once the Ganga’s width was more than 700 metres, it has now shrunk to 500 to 600 metres. The river’s discharge [flow rate] has also decreased significantly compared to earlier. If awareness does not come, then in the coming days this situation could become even more alarming.” Prof. U.K. Choudhary, former Chairman of the Ganga Lab at BHU, said: “We keep constructing permanent ghats and bridges in the Ganga... without thinking about what impact this will have on the river’s flow. No studies, no evaluations.... What is truly needed is a scientific understanding of the river’s flow, its current, its bed, and its banks. How strange it is that we want to decorate the city of Banaras from above, yet we refuse to see how hollow its roots have become.” Also Read | Frontline Explains: India’s climate emergency The construction of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor and Namo Ghat has proved that governments only know how to make glittering plans, with no scientific basis. Boats are navigating through narrow alleys, and people fleeing the rising waters to their rooftops are cursing the “development” that has brought this calamity. The activist Lenin Raghuvanshi, convenor of People’s Vigilance Committee on Human Rights, said, “People built houses on the riverbed of the Ganga and Varuna, and now when those houses are [flooding], they ask, ‘Why has the flood come?’ The answer is clear. Those who settled in the belly of the river were bound to be swept away one day.” He said a High Court order had banned construction up to 500 metres on both banks of the Ganga, but no one ever seems to have followed it. “In the name of Ganga rejuvenation, crores of rupees have been spent so far, without any transparent accounting or concrete evidence of the government’s achievements. After winning the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the Ganga as his mother. Yet, the river’s condition has only worsened since then. Critics allege that during the construction of the Vishwanath Corridor, the government treated the Ganga like an empty plot of land, laying stones into its basin and choking its natural flow. No measures were taken to ensure the river could flow in its original form, despite the Ganga being regarded as a living, emotional, and cultural entity.” A senior journalist from Banaras, Rajeev Maurya, questioned the policies and intentions of the Modi-Yogi governments, saying, “Is this flood-ravaged Kashi the same one that was shown the dream of becoming ‘Kyoto’?... Is sidelining the soul of rivers, their ecosystems, their cultural existence, real progress? Until we make plans by understanding her as a ‘mother’ and not just a river, she will continue to wail like this, and Banaras, which is cradled in her lap, will keep drowning like this.” Vijay Vineet is a senior journalist and writer based in Varanasi.

Despite significant investment, the city's development along the river's course leads to catastrophic flooding, affecting daily life, religious practices, and leaving residents displaced or seeking refuge on rooftops.",
      "ai_content": "In what seems like a cruel twist of fate, Varanasi—a city renowned for its spiritual heritage—is grappling with severe flooding issues despite being touted as India's first 'Smart City'. Envisioned by the Central government, Varanasi was meant to showcase advanced urban planning with grandiose ghats and modern amenities. However, the reality starkly contrasts with these aspirations; torrential rains trigger annual floods that threaten lives and livelihoods.\nThe city's transformation began years ago with ambitious projects such as the Vishwanath Corridor and Namo Ghat, which inadvertently obstructed natural waterways. As the monsoon season approaches, the Ganga swells beyond control, submerging parts of Varanasi under water. Residents find themselves forced out of their homes, taking shelter atop buildings or using boats where cars used to drive. Even revered sites like the cremation ghats of Manikarnika and Harishchandra fall victim to the deluge, disrupting centuries-old rituals and turning them into makeshift markets.\nThe situation grows dire as funeral rites face unprecedented challenges—the scarcity of wood for pyres compels families to pay exorbitant fees for transportation services across flooded pathways. Activists describe the scene as heart-wrenching, with ambulances unable to navigate the flooded alleys and people bearing coffins on their shoulders amidst relentless downpours.\nAs the floodwaters encroach upon historical landmarks including Ramnagar Fort and nearby temples, questions arise about the wisdom behind investing millions in creating a smart city if not enough foresight was given to protect against nature's wrath. The recurring pattern of destruction raises concerns among citizens who witness their beloved city succumb to the very element it's supposed to master.",

      "description": "The Voting Rights Act was signed into law 60 years ago but has been slowly eroding for more than a decade",
      "content": "WASHINGTON -- Wednesday is the 60th anniversary of the day President Lyndon Johnson made his way to the U.S. Capitol and, with Martin Luther King Jr. standing behind him, signed the Voting Rights Act into law. The act protected the right to vote and ensured the government would fight efforts to suppress it, especially those aimed at Black voters. For many Americans, it was the day U.S. democracy fully began . That was then. The law has been slowly eroding for more than a decade, starting with the 2013 Supreme Court decision ending the requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. Within hours of the ruling , some states that had been under the preclearance provision began announcing plans for stricter voting laws. Those changes have continued, especially since the 2020 presidential election and President Donald Trump's false claims that widespread fraud cost him reelection. The Supreme Court upheld a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, but in its upcoming term it's scheduled to hear a case that could roll back that decision and another that would effectively neuter the law. Voting rights experts say those cases will largely determine whether a landmark law passed during a turbulent era decades ago will have future anniversaries to mark. “We’re at a critical juncture right now,\" said Demetria McCain, director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \"And, let’s be clear, our democracy is only about to turn 60 when the Voting Rights Act anniversary gets here. I say that because there are so many attacks on voting rights, particularly as it relates to Black communities and communities of color.\" The reservation of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Canadian border, a region of forests, small lakes and vast prairie land. Its main highway is a mix of small houses, mobile homes and businesses. A gleaming casino and hotel stand out, not far from grazing bison. In 2024, the tribe and another in North Dakota, the Spirit Lake Tribe, formed a joint political district for the first time. They had filed a lawsuit arguing that the way lines were drawn for state legislative seats denied them the right to elect candidates of their choice. U.S. District Court Chief Judge Peter Welte agreed and put a new map in place . State Rep. Collette Brown ran for the legislature because she wanted to see more Native American representation, and she won under the new map. “It felt surreal. I felt accomplished, I felt recognized,\" said Brown, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and the Spirit Lake Tribe’s Gaming Commission executive director. “I felt, OK, it’s time for us to really start making change and really start educating from within so that we’re not silenced.” Brown, a Democrat, co-sponsored several bills on Native American issues that became law, including aid for repatriation of remains and artifacts and alerts for missing Indigenous people. This year's anniversary of the Voting Rights Act “forces you to look at how far we’ve come,” from Native Americans to women, said Jamie Azure, chairman of the Turtle Mountain tribe. Now the future of their district is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals , which covers North Dakota and six other states, overturned Welte's decision 2-1 , saying the tribes and entities such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the ACLU do not have a right to sue over potential violations of voters' constitutional rights. That ruling expanded on an earlier 8th Circuit opinion out of Arkansas that rejected a different challenge on the same grounds. Late last month, a 3rd Circuit court panel ruled in a separate case out of Arkansas that only the U.S. attorney general can file such cases — not private individuals or groups. Those decisions upended decades of precedent. The Supreme Court has stayed the ruling for the tribes while it decides whether it will take the North Dakota case. The University of Michigan Law School Voting Rights Initiative found that since 1982 nearly 87% of claims under that part of the Voting Rights Act, known as Section 2, were from private individuals and organizations.

The government’s voting rights unit has been dismantled and given new priorities that, she said, have turned enforcement “against the very people it was created to protect .\" The Justice Department declined to answer questions about its voting rights priorities, cases it is pursuing or whether it would be involved in the voting rights cases coming before the nation's highest court. Two years ago, voting rights activists celebrated when the Supreme Court preserved Section 2 in a case out of Alabama that required the state to draw an addition congressional district to benefit Black voters. Now it's poised to rehear a similar case out of Louisiana that could modify or undo that decision. The court heard the case in March but did not make a decision during the term. In an order on Friday, the court asked the lawyers to supply briefs explaining “whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution.” Robert Weiner, the director of voting rights for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said while it is a “matter of concern” that the court is asking the question, the fact the nine justices did not reach a decision during the last term suggests there weren’t five votes already. “They wouldn’t need re-argument if the sides had already been chosen,“ he said. At a time when the remaining protections of the Voting Rights Act are under threat, the Justice Department has shifted its election-related priorities. Under Attorney General Pam Bondi , it has dropped or withdrawn from several election- and voting-related cases. The department instead has focused on concerns of voter fraud raised by conservative activists following years of false claims surrounding elections. The department also has sent requests for voter registration information as well as data on election fraud and warnings of election violations to at least 19 states. In addition to the shift in focus at the Justice Department, federal legislation to protect voting rights has gone nowhere. Democrats have reintroduced the John Lewis voting rights bill , but it's legislation they failed to pass in 2022 when they held both houses of Congress and the White House and needed some Republican support in the Senate. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order seeking to overhaul voting in the states, which includes a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement on the federal voting form, though much of it has been blocked in the courts. The GOP-controlled House passed a bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. And gerrymandering state legislative and congressional districts remains prevalent. The slow chipping away at the 60-year-old law has created a nation with an unequal distribution of voting rights, said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights center at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Some states have been active in expanding access to voting while others have been focused on restricting the vote . “The last five to 10 years,\" he said, “the experiences of voters increasingly depend on where they live.” ___ Dura reported from Belcourt, N.D.

      "ai_summary": "On the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act, concerns arise as its protections against voter suppression face challenges. Originally enacted to protect minority voters' rights, the Act's effectiveness has diminished following a 2013 Supreme Court decision removing the preclearance requirement for certain states. This led to new restrictive voting laws post-2020 election amid unfounded allegations of widespread fraud. Upcoming Supreme Court cases threaten further erosion of these protections, raising alarms among civil rights advocates who fear significant impacts on democratic processes, particularly within Black and other communities of color.",
      "ai_content": "As America commemorates the 60th anniversary of one of its most pivotal pieces of legislation—the Voting Rights Act—concerns mount regarding the durability of its foundational principles. Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Act represented a monumental step towards ensuring equal access to the ballot box, specifically targeting historical racial injustices in voting practices. However, nearly two decades after its inception, the Act faces unprecedented threats to its integrity.\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court struck down Section 4(b), which contained the formula determining which jurisdictions required federal oversight prior to implementing electoral changes—a safeguard known as 'preclearance.' This judicial pivot allowed several previously covered states to enact stringent voting regulations almost immediately thereafter. These included measures such as reduced early voting periods, strict ID requirements, and purging of voter rolls—all ostensibly justified by combating alleged voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence supporting systemic issues.\nThe aftermath saw a surge in legal battles across various states seeking to implement similar restrictions. Critics argue that these moves disproportionately affect marginalized groups, undermining the very essence of what the Voting Rights Act sought to achieve. The situation reached a fever pitch around the contentious 2020 presidential election cycle, where former President Donald Trump propagated baseless claims of extensive electoral malfeasance, fueling calls for even tighter controls.\nDespite these setbacks, a glimmer of hope emerged in 2023 when the Supreme Court reaffirmed crucial aspects of the Voting Rights Act through a narrow majority decision. Yet, looming on the horizon are two high-stakes cases set for review in the current term. Should either result in a rollback of established protections or render the Act toothless, it may signify a profound shift away from half a century of progress toward equitable representation.\nDemetria McCain, Director of Policy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, encapsulates the sentiment shared by many activists:",

      "description": "A Georgian journalist has been convicted of slapping a senior police officer at an anti-government protest and sentenced to two years in prison in a case that was condemned by rights groups as an attack on press freedom",
      "content": "A prominent Georgian journalist was convicted Wednesday of slapping a senior police officer during an anti-government protest and sentenced to two years in prison in a case that was condemned by rights groups as curbing press freedom. Mzia Amaghlobeli, who founded two of Georgia’s independent media outlets, was convicted in the coastal city of Batumi. She was initially charged with assault, an offense that carried a maximum prison sentence of up to seven years, but the judge in the end found her guilty on the lighter charge of resistance, threats or violence against a defender of the public order or other government official. The case is just one of many to draw protests and international criticism in recent months as the ruling Georgian Dream party has been accused of eroding civil society and democratic rights in the South Caucasus nation. A visibly gaunt Amaghlobeli, 50, heard the verdict in the Batumi City Court packed with journalists and supporters, while a protest was held outside the courthouse. Sporadic chants of “Free Mzia!” broke out both outside the courthouse and in the courtroom. She was arrested Jan. 12, one of over 50 people taken into custody on criminal charges from a series of demonstrations in the country of 3.7 million. Video shared by Georgian media outlets showed Amaghlobeli striking Police Chief Irakli Dgebuadze. Amaghlobeli said that after she was detained, Dgebuadze spat at her and tried to attack her. Her lawyer told the court she reacted emotionally after getting caught in a stampede, falling, and witnessing the arrest of those close to her. She also said a police investigation was not impartial and she did not receive a fair trial. In a closing statement Monday, Amaghlobeli described chaotic scenes at the protest. “In a completely peaceful setting, the police suddenly appear, create chaos, and surround me with masked officers,\" she said. \"As a result of strong pushes and blows from behind, I fall to the asphalt. Then they trample over me with their feet.” She added that she was abused at the police station after her arrest. She also thanked her colleagues and the activists for their continued resistance, and urged them to fight on. “You must never lose faith in your own capabilities. There is still time. The fight continues— until victory!” she said. Amaghlobeli is the founder and manager of investigative news outlet Batumelebi, which covers politics, corruption and human rights in Georgia. She also founded its sister publication, Netgazeti. In a joint statement in January, 14 embassies, including those of France, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K., said Amaghlobeli’s case represented “another worrying example of the intimidation of journalists in Georgia, restricting media freedom and freedom of expression.” Popular Reads As manhunt intensifies for suspect, officials ID 4 victims in Montana bar shooting Aug 3, 4:46 PM 3 dead and 67 sick from growing Legionnaires' disease cluster in New York City Aug 5, 6:29 PM Mom brought kids to safety before she and husband stabbed to death on trail: Police Jul 31, 4:21 PM Gypsy Guillén Kaiser, advocacy and communications director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, warned that Amaghlobeli’s case was “a sign of the declining environment for press freedom in Georgia and a symbol for the fight between truth and control.” “You have to decide whether you’re going to vilify journalists, criminalize them, and present them as nefarious characters with malicious intent in order to control information, or whether you’re going to have a public that is truly free, freely informed and empowered,” Guillén Kaiser said. “And that is a fundamental question for every country and for Georgia specifically right now.” Leading Georgian officials defended her arrest. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze accused her of seeking to fulfill a “directive” to discredit police but did not provide proof or say who was behind it. “She attempted to discredit the law enforcement structures, to discredit the police, but she received exactly the kind of response such actions deserve,” he said. “Those who are trying to undermine statehood in Georgia are the ones who are upset by this. But this will not succeed — we will defend the interests of our state to the end.” Georgia has seen widespread political unrest and protests since its parliamentary election on Oct. 26, which was won by Georgian Dream. Protesters and the country’s opposition declared the result illegitimate amid allegations of vote-rigging aided by Russia. At the time, opposition leaders vowed to boycott sessions of parliament until a new election could be held under international supervision and alleged ballot irregularities were investigated. Nearly all the leaders of Georgia’s pro-Western opposition parties have been jailed for refusing to testify at a parliamentary inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by the government of former President Mikhail Saakashvili, a probe that critics of Georgian Dream say is an act of political revenge. The critics accuse Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the party has denied. It recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Among controversial legislation passed by Georgian Dream is the so-called “ foreign influence law,\" which requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power.” That law later was replaced with one called the Foreign Agent’s Registration Act, under which individuals or organizations considered as “agents of a foreign principal” must register with the government or face penalties, including criminal prosecution and imprisonment. Members of civil society fear that the law’s broad definition of “foreign agent” could be used to label any critical media outlet or nongovernmental organization as acting on behalf of a foreign entity. Many independent news outlets receive grants from abroad to fund their work. “I think that the main goal of the government was to scare us, for us to leave the country or shut down or change profession,” says Mariam Nikuradze, founder of the OC Media outlet. Most journalists still want to stay in the country, she said, and cover what she described as growing authoritarian rule. “Everybody’s being very brave and everybody’s very motivated,” she said.",

      "ai_content": "Mzia Amaghlobeli, a well-known figure in Georgian journalism known for founding several independent media platforms, faced legal repercussions for her involvement in political activism. On January 12th, amidst widespread detentions related to protests across Georgia—a country home to approximately 3.7 million residents—Amaghlobeli struck a senior police officer named Irakli Dgebuadze during an anti-government demonstration. This incident led to her subsequent arrest and trial where she was ultimately convicted under lesser charges than originally brought forth.\nThe Batumi City Court delivered its judgment amid tumultuous scenes involving protesters chanting 'Free Mzia!' outside the courthouse premises. Despite being offered a defense based on emotional distress caused by the circumstances leading to her confrontation with law enforcement—including allegations of an unfair trial due to biased investigations—the court ruled otherwise. Amaghlobeli recounted how she fell victim to what she perceived as excessive force when confronted by riot police, resulting in physical harm before being subjected to further mistreatment within the precincts.\nHer sentencing came as no surprise given the tense atmosphere in which these events unfolded; Georgia had seen numerous arrests linked to dissenting voices calling for greater transparency and accountability from the ruling Georgian Dream party. Rights advocates have voiced concerns about the erosion of freedoms traditionally enjoyed in the South Caucasus region, suggesting that such incidents reflect a troubling trend towards authoritarianism.\nAmaghlobeli's plight underscores the precarious position of journalists operating within environments increasingly hostile to free expression. As she faces time behind bars, questions linger regarding the future of investigative reporting and civic engagement in Georgia, especially considering the government's track record of stifling opposition through various means.",

      "content": "European search engines Qwant and Ecosia said on Wednesday that they have both started serving search queries through an index they developed together, Staan , which aims to be a cheaper, more privacy-focused alternative to Google and Bing. Last year, French privacy-focused search engine Qwant struck a joint venture with German non-profit search engine Ecosia, to develop a European search index . Called European Search Perspective (EUSP), the JV now aims to serve around 50% of French queries and 33% of German queries by the end of the year. Qwant said it is using the new index to power some of its features, like AI summaries for search, and Ecosia has plans to add some AI features soon to its platform, too. EUSP is also in talks with companies to spur the adoption of its index for enabling search within apps. Notably, it is targeting chatbots, presenting Staan as a cheaper alternative to Google and Bing. “If you’re using ChatGPT or any other AI chatbot, they all do knowledge grounding with web search [...] our index can power deep research and AI summary features. Google and Bing’s solutions are also pricey, and our index can offer power search features at a tenth of the cost,” Christian Kroll, CEO of Ecosia, told TechCrunch. EUSP, like Proton , is pushing to develop a European tech stack that doesn’t rely on technology from the U.S. or China. “The timing could not be more urgent. The outcome of the 2024 U.S. election has reminded European policymakers and innovators just how exposed Europe remains when it comes to core digital infrastructure. Much of Europe’s search, cloud, and AI layers are built on American Big Tech stacks, putting entire sectors – from journalism to climate tech – at the mercy of political or commercial agendas,” the companies said in a statement. Kroll added that through this index, combined with European privacy laws, EUSP can offer a more privacy-friendly search solution as compared to its U.S. counterparts.",

      "content": "Khawaja Asif has also made startling allegations against former minister of Pakistan's Punjab Province Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has stirred controversy with explosive allegations, accusing the country’s top bureaucrats of large-scale corruption and money laundering. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Asif claimed that billions of dollars in illicit funds have been siphoned off to Portugal by senior officials, many of whom are allegedly acquiring property and pursuing citizenship in the European country as part of a discreet escape plan. Asif alleged that more than half of Pakistan’s bureaucratic elite have purchased real estate in Portugal using “black money.” He criticised the prevailing system, saying politicians are often unfairly blamed while bureaucrats walk away with the lion’s share of the wealth. “Politicians only get what is left over by them and still get blamed for everything,” he wrote, adding that most elected representatives do not hold foreign assets because they must remain accountable to the public. In one particularly startling claim, Asif said a senior bureaucrat with close ties to former Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar received Rs 4 billion in ceremonial gifts—referred to as ‘salami’—at his daughter’s wedding. He pointed to the incident as an example of the opulence and impunity with which the bureaucracy operates. Calling the officials’ conduct “shameful,” Asif declared, “This bureaucracy is polluting our land.” These claims surface just ahead of a crucial visit by a joint team from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Asia Pacific Group (APG), expected to arrive in Pakistan this August. The delegation is scheduled to conduct an evaluation following repeated complaints about Pakistan’s alleged involvement in terror financing and the reemergence of grey money channels.

      "ai_content": "In a shocking revelation, Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Khawaja Asif accused top government officials of engaging in massive corruption and funneling ill-gotten gains abroad, specifically to Portugal. On social media, Asif detailed how these corrupt practices involve purchasing luxury homes under false pretenses and obtaining dual citizenships. He highlighted that such activities represent a significant portion of the country's bureaucratic class, suggesting systemic issues within the governance structure.\nAsif further criticized the disparity between political leaders' financial transparency and the secretive nature of bureaucratic wealth accumulation. He argued that politicians face undue blame despite their limited access to foreign assets, unlike some members of the bureaucracy. One striking allegation involved a senior official receiving $4 billion worth of gifts at a daughter's wedding—a practice referred to locally as 'salami.'\nThese accusations emerged amidst growing international scrutiny, with a joint FATF/APG team set to evaluate Pakistan's anti-money laundering measures next month. This comes after persistent reports linking Pakistan to terrorist financing networks and the resurgence of unregulated financial flows.\nThe timing raises questions about potential repercussions for those implicated if the allegations prove true. Meanwhile, Pakistan grapples with other challenges, including the impending deportation of registered Afghan refugees, according to UNHCR, and domestic unrest related to former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party.",

      "description": "A Georgian journalist has been convicted of slapping a police chief at an anti-government protest and sentenced to two years in prison in a case that was condemned by rights groups as an attack on press freedom.",
      "content": "A prominent Georgian journalist was convicted Wednesday of slapping a police chief during an anti-government protest and sentenced to two years in prison in a case that was condemned by rights groups as curbing press freedom. Mzia Amaghlobeli, who founded two of Georgia’s independent media outlets, was convicted in the coastal city of Batumi. She was initially charged with assault, an offense that carried a maximum prison sentence of up to seven years, but the judge in the end found her guilty on the lighter charge of resistance, threats or violence against a defender of the public order or other government official. Recommended Videos The case is just one of many to draw protests and international criticism in recent months as the ruling Georgian Dream party has been accused of eroding civil society and democratic rights in the South Caucasus nation. Chants of support as verdict was read A visibly gaunt Amaghlobeli, 50, heard the verdict in the Batumi City Court packed with journalists and supporters, while a protest was held outside the courthouse. Sporadic chants of “Free Mzia!” broke out both outside the courthouse and in the courtroom. She was arrested Jan. 12, one of over 50 people taken into custody on criminal charges from a series of demonstrations in the country of 3.7 million. Video shared by Georgian media outlets showed Amaghlobeli striking Police Chief Irakli Dgebuadze. Amaghlobeli said that after she was detained, Dgebuadze spat at her and tried to attack her. Her lawyer told the court she reacted emotionally after getting caught in a stampede, falling, and witnessing the arrest of those close to her. She also said a police investigation was not impartial and she did not receive a fair trial. In a closing statement Monday, Amaghlobeli described chaotic scenes at the protest. “In a completely peaceful setting, the police suddenly appear, create chaos, and surround me with masked officers,\" she said. \"As a result of strong pushes and blows from behind, I fall to the asphalt. Then they trample over me with their feet.” She added that she was abused at the police station after her arrest. She also thanked her colleagues and the activists for their continued resistance, and urged them to fight on. “You must never lose faith in your own capabilities. There is still time. The fight continues— until victory!” she said. Western countries cite intimidation of journalists Amaghlobeli is the founder and manager of investigative news outlet Batumelebi, which covers politics, corruption and human rights in Georgia. She also founded its sister publication, Netgazeti. In a joint statement in January, 14 embassies, including those of France, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K., said Amaghlobeli’s case represented “another worrying example of the intimidation of journalists in Georgia, restricting media freedom and freedom of expression.” Gypsy Guillén Kaiser, advocacy and communications director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, warned that Amaghlobeli’s case was “a sign of the declining environment for press freedom in Georgia and a symbol for the fight between truth and control.” “You have to decide whether you’re going to vilify journalists, criminalize them, and present them as nefarious characters with malicious intent in order to control information, or whether you’re going to have a public that is truly free, freely informed and empowered,” Guillén Kaiser said. “And that is a fundamental question for every country and for Georgia specifically right now.” Leading Georgian officials defended her arrest. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze accused her of seeking to fulfill a “directive” to discredit police but did not provide proof or say who was behind it. “She attempted to discredit the law enforcement structures, to discredit the police, but she received exactly the kind of response such actions deserve,” he said. “Those who are trying to undermine statehood in Georgia are the ones who are upset by this. But this will not succeed — we will defend the interests of our state to the end.” Political unrest since a disputed election Georgia has seen widespread political unrest and protests since its parliamentary election on Oct. 26, which was won by Georgian Dream. Protesters and the country’s opposition declared the result illegitimate amid allegations of vote-rigging aided by Russia. At the time, opposition leaders vowed to boycott sessions of parliament until a new election could be held under international supervision and alleged ballot irregularities were investigated. Nearly all the leaders of Georgia’s pro-Western opposition parties have been jailed for refusing to testify at a parliamentary inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by the government of former President Mikhail Saakashvili, a probe that critics of Georgian Dream say is an act of political revenge. The critics accuse Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the party has denied. It recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Among controversial legislation passed by Georgian Dream is the so-called “ foreign influence law,\" which requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power.” That law later was replaced with one called the Foreign Agent’s Registration Act, under which individuals or organizations considered as “agents of a foreign principal” must register with the government or face penalties, including criminal prosecution and imprisonment. Members of civil society fear that the law’s broad definition of “foreign agent” could be used to label any critical media outlet or nongovernmental organization as acting on behalf of a foreign entity. Many independent news outlets receive grants from abroad to fund their work. “I think that the main goal of the government was to scare us, for us to leave the country or shut down or change profession,” says Mariam Nikuradze, founder of the OC Media outlet. Most journalists still want to stay in the country, she said, and cover what she described as growing authoritarian rule. “Everybody’s being very brave and everybody’s very motivated,” she said.",

Despite being charged with assault, which could have led to a potential seven-year imprisonment, Judge Valery Kapanadze opted instead for a conviction based on resisting law enforcement actions deemed threatening towards officials.\nThe Batumi City Court's judgment drew immediate condemnation from human rights organizations, highlighting fears of diminishing freedoms within Georgia's political landscape. As Amaghlobeli awaited sentencing, demonstrators gathered outside the courthouse chanting 'Free Mzia!' Supporters filled the courtroom alongside journalists eager to witness the proceedings firsthand.\nDuring her defense, Amaghlobeli recounted the tumultuous events leading to her detention; she claimed emotional distress caused by a violent encounter where she fell victim to a crowd surge followed by physical abuse at the hands of authorities. Her attorney argued that the investigative procedures were biased and lacked fairness.\nAmaghlobeli's final remarks painted a picture of disorder instigated by sudden police intervention at what had started as a nonviolent assembly. She detailed how she suffered further mistreatment upon arrival at the precincts before receiving her sentence.",

      "description": "Daniel Jackson, a 20-year-old Australian, founded the Free Republic of Verdis in a disputed area between Croatia and Serbia.",
      "content": "A 20-year-old Australian man has captured global attention after proclaiming himself the president of a self-declared nation situated in a disputed no-man's-land between Croatia and Serbia. Daniel Jackson is the founder of the Free Republic of Verdis , a self-styled micronation occupying a 125-acre patch of forest along the Danube River. According to a report by the New York Post , the territory lies in a legal grey zone, an unclaimed piece of land known as “pocket three” that neither Croatia nor Serbia officially recognises due to an ongoing border dispute. What Is Verdis? Verdis was Jackson’s passion project, first conceived when he was just 14. “It was just a bit of an experiment at first with a few mates. We all dreamed of creating something crazy,” he told the publication. By 18, Jackson, a digital designer who creates virtual worlds on platforms like Roblox, began formalising his vision. On May 30, 2019, he declared the independence of the Free Republic of Verdis. Since then, he has created a flag, a basic constitution, a cabinet of ministers, and claims the micronation now has around 400 “citizens” worldwide. English, Croatian, and Serbian are listed as official languages, and the Euro is used as currency. Verdis is only accessible by boat from the Croatian city of Osijek, though not without resistance. Who is Daniel Jackson? Born on December 7, 2004, in Upper Ferntree Gully, Australia, Daniel Jackson is the incumbent President of the Free Republic of Verdis. Jackson has been serving as the President of the Free Republic of Verdis since the 30th of May 2019. Since entering office, Jackson’s administration has been largely dedicated to working towards international recognition, funding, and the overall nation-building of the Free Republic of Verdis. Trouble with Croatian authorities Jackson’s efforts to physically settle in Verdis haven’t gone smoothly. In October 2023, Croatian police reportedly detained and deported several Verdis supporters, including Jackson himself. He now claims to be banned for life from entering Croatia. “They deported us, but couldn’t give a reason why. They said we were a threat to homeland security,” he said. Now operating what he calls a “government-in-exile,” Jackson alleges that Croatian authorities have ramped up patrols along Verdis’ shoreline to prevent entry from the Serbian side. Despite the tension, he says he hopes to establish peaceful diplomatic ties with both countries in the future. “We’ve had a lot of problems with the Croatian authorities, but we want a good relationship with them eventually,” Jackson added. Passports, politics and plans ahead Every citizen of Verdis is issued a passport, although Jackson warns that they’re not valid for international travel. That said, he claims some people have successfully entered other countries using Verdisian passports. The micronation is also selective about who can become a citizen, with preference reportedly given to individuals with medical, security, or legal expertise, roles Jackson says are critical for a small, developing society. Though he currently serves as president, Jackson insists he isn’t power-hungry. If Verdis gains wider recognition or physical control of the land, he says he would step down and call for democratic elections. Despite setbacks and scepticism, Jackson remains optimistic. His argument is simple: since neither Croatia nor Serbia claims the land, Verdis has every right to.",

Despite its ambitions for sovereignty, Jackson faces challenges such as being barred entry into Croatia by local authorities.",
      "ai_content": "In a remarkable display of youthful ambition and creativity, Daniel Jackson, a young Australian national, has taken upon himself the role of founding father for the Free Republic of Verdis—a self-proclaimed sovereign state nestled within a contentious no-man's-land straddling Croatia and Serbia. This audacious venture emerged out of Jackson's fascination with micronations during his teenage years, evolving from playful experimentation among friends to a serious political endeavor.\nJackson, born in Australia in 2004, had already developed a penchant for constructing virtual realms before turning his sights to reality. His latest creation came to fruition on May 30, 2019, marking the birth of Verdis amidst the lush forests adjacent to the Danube River. Spanning approximately 125 acres—an expanse referred to locally as 'pocket three'—the territory remains outside the purview of either nation's official boundaries owing to unresolved territorial disputes.\nThe fledgling republic boasts a modest population of roughly 400 individuals hailing from various corners of the globe. These residents have embraced a trilingual identity, speaking English, Croatian, and Serbian, while adopting the Euro as their monetary unit. Jackson's government-in-exile operates primarily through online channels, offering services akin to those found in traditional states.\nDespite these strides toward establishing a functioning society, Jackson's aspirations face significant obstacles. Notably, tensions with Croatian officials culminated in October 2023 when Jackson and other advocates were forcibly removed from the region under dubious pretexts related to homeland security concerns. Jackson contends that they remain prohibited from re-entering Croatian soil indefinitely.\nAs Jackson continues to navigate the complexities of international diplomacy and internal governance, the story of the Free Republic of Verdis stands as a testament to one man's determination to carve out a niche in the world's intricate tapestry of nations.",

In the Moderna U.S. litigation, fact discovery has been completed, and expert discovery is concluding. The summary judgment phase of the case began in July 2025 and a jury trial is scheduled to be held in March 2026. Additionally, in July 2025, the case was reassigned to a different judge in the same court. In March 2025, the Company, alongside Genevant Sciences, filed five international lawsuits against Moderna and its affiliates seeking to enforce patents protecting the Company’s patented LNP technology across 30 countries. The first major hearings in the international lawsuits are expected in the first half of calendar year 2026. The claim construction hearing for the lawsuit against Pfizer/BioNTech occurred in December 2024. The court has not provided guidance for the timing of its ruling in the claim construction hearing, which could potentially come in 2025.

Janssen, MD, PhD, joined the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board effective August 1, 2025, increasing the membership to six global experts in cHBV treatment. Dr. Janssen is a Professor of Hepatology and the Chair of the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Effective August 4, 2025, Anuj Hasija resigned from the Company’s Board of Directors due to his transition to a full-time executive role that precludes his participation on the Arbutus and other boards of directors. Filling the vacancy on our Board of Directors, Dr. Roger Sawhney, MD, joined the Board effective August 4, 2025. Dr. Sawhney is a seasoned executive and board member with extensive experience across biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, healthcare technology, and investment sectors. He holds an MD from Harvard Medical School and a BA in Economics from Stanford University. Financial Results Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments As of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of $98.1 million compared to $122.6 million as of December 31, 2024. During the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company used $29.1 million in operating activities, which included one-time payments related to our restructuring efforts. This was partially offset by $3.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. Revenue Total revenue was $10.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2024. The increase of $9.0 million was primarily due to the recognition of all previously-deferred revenue as a result of the conclusion of the Company’s strategic partnership with Qilu Pharmaceutical, partially offset by a decrease in license royalty revenues due to a decline in Alnylam’s sales of ONPATTRO. Operating Expenses Research and development expenses were $5.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $10.1 million was due primarily to cost savings from the Company’s decision in August 2024 to streamline the organization to focus its efforts on advancing the clinical development of imdusiran and AB-101, which included ceasing all discovery efforts, discontinuing its IM-PROVE III clinical trial and reducing the Company’s workforce. General and administrative expenses were $3.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2024. This decrease was due primarily to cost cutting efforts by the Company, which drove reductions in litigation-related legal fees and employee compensation-related expenses. Restructuring costs in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 were $0.2 million, and all remaining restructuring-related payments are expected to be made in the second half of 2025. Net Income/Loss For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, the Company’s net income was $2.5 million, or income of $0.01 per basic and diluted common share, as compared to a net loss of $19.8 million, or a loss of $0.11 per basic and diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Outstanding Shares As of June 30, 2025, the Company had 191.6 million common shares issued and outstanding, as well as 15.2 million stock options and unvested restricted stock units outstanding.

Imdusiran targets hepatocytes using Arbutus’ novel covalently conjugated N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) delivery technology enabling subcutaneous delivery. To date, Arbutus has reported a total of eight patients with cHBV who have achieved a functional cure following treatment with imdusiran and NA therapy in combination with either IFN or low dose nivolumab plus an immunotherapeutic. Clinical data generated thus far has shown imdusiran to be generally safe and well-tolerated, while also providing meaningful reductions in HBsAg and hepatitis B virus DNA. About HBV Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV can cause chronic infection which leads to a higher risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. cHBV infection represents a significant unmet medical need. The World Health Organization estimates that over 250 million people worldwide suffer from cHBV infection, while other estimates indicate that approximately 2 million people in the United States suffer from cHBV infection. Approximately 1.1 million people die every year from complications related to cHBV infection despite the availability of effective vaccines and current treatment options. About Arbutus Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on infectious disease. The company is currently developing imdusiran (AB-729) and an oral PD-L1 inhibitor (AB-101) for the treatment of cHBV infection. The Company is also consulting closely with and supporting its exclusive licensee, Genevant Sciences, to protect and defend its intellectual property, which is the subject of on-going lawsuits against Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech for use of Arbutus’s patented LNP technology in their COVID-19 vaccines.

      "description": "Whether it's in free agency or at the trade deadline, David Stearns isn't compromising on his starting pitching philosophy.",
      "content": "NEW YORK -- David Stearns was about to disappear into the New York Mets ' clubhouse Monday afternoon when he stopped to answer questions about the one prominent potential flaw remaining on his roster after the trade deadline: the starting rotation. The glaring inability of Mets starters to pitch deep into games over the past two months -- David Peterson is the only one to log at least six innings in an outing over the past month -- prompted fans to plead for the Mets' president of baseball operations to fortify the rotation. After he elected not to acquire a starting pitcher at the trade deadline, the talk has turned to potentially improving from within by promoting Brandon Sproat or Nolan McLean, two standout pitching prospects excelling in Triple-A. \"I think it's always a combination of when, developmentally, those guys are ready,\" Stearns said. \"And also when there's the need and how to fit it on the roster. And so we may get to the point where we decide that it's the best thing to do to bring one or both of them here. But we're not at that point right now.\" The Mets' front office acted aggressively ahead of last Thursday's deadline, acquiring three top-tier relievers ( Ryan Helsley , Tyler Rogers and Gregory Soto ) to strengthen a taxed bullpen, and a veteran center fielder ( Cedric Mullins ) to improve the lineup. But while Stearns said he \"engaged\" teams on starting pitchers -- including Washington Nationals All-Star left-hander MacKenzie Gore , sources told ESPN -- he determined the costs were too high. Editor's Picks Biggest concern, what's left to play for and more: Post-trade-deadline guide for all 30 MLB teams 17h Bradford Doolittle The team that absolutely cooked, most frustrated fan bases and more: Passan's 2025 MLB trade deadline awards 2d Jeff Passan The Mets were far from the only World Series contender to not bolster their starting rotation in a deadline with an exorbitant trade demand for the few available. But the difference between most of those clubs and the Mets is that refusing to pay the going rate for elite major league starting pitchers -- whether in free agency or via the trade market -- has been a fundamental principle in Stearns' roster building. One of the mysteries surrounding Stearns' move to New York after a hugely successful seven-year run leading the small-market Milwaukee Brewers was how he would use owner Steve Cohen's deep pockets. The Mets have spent large sums of money -- they gave Juan Soto the richest contract in North American sports history in December -- but Stearns has remained disciplined and methodical in building his pitching staff, preferring starting pitchers he says he believes have untapped potential. After an unexpected run to the National League Championship Series without a true ace last fall, the Mets head into the stretch run this season with the same missing ingredient. \"I think there are multiple ways to build a pitching staff and we focused on the back end of the pitching staff, the bullpen,\" Stearns said. \"We're really happy with the arms we were able to acquire who are going to pitch out of our pen and we have confidence, not only in the stars who are here who we think are going to keep us competitive and help us win games, we are also pleased with the development of how some of the guys in Triple-A are progressing. And we understand that they could, may not definitely, but they could be part of the mix going forward if needed.\" A new world in Big Apple baseball The inside story of Steve Cohen, Hal Steinbrenner and the battle for New York hardball supremacy. Jorge Castillo » The Mets strongly pursued Yoshinobu Yamamoto before last season and offered him a contract similar to the 12-year, $325 million deal -- the largest ever for a pitcher -- Yamamoto signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers . But Yamamoto was an outlier -- not just an already highly accomplished pitcher in Japan, but, just as importantly, only 25 years old. That rare combination of age and talent met Stearns' criteria to offer an expensive long-term contract. Ultimately, the Mets signed Sean Manaea to a one-year deal with an option and Luis Severino to a one-year contract for the rotation, then opted for a similar blueprint this past winter, choosing not to strongly pursue any of the top three starting pitchers ( Corbin Burnes , Max Fried and Blake Snell ) on the free agent market. Stearns instead re-signed Manaea to a three-year, $75 million deal (the biggest contract Stearns has given to a starting pitcher), inked Clay Holmes to a three-year, $38 million deal (with an opt out after 2026) to convert him from a reliever to a starter, gave Frankie Montas a two-year, $34 million contract (with an opt out after this season), and added Griffin Canning on a one-year deal. \"I still think it's really valuable and there have been teams that I've been around in my career that have had one or multiple ace-level starters on their staff and got bounced early in the playoffs and that can be tough to figure out sometimes too,\" Stearns said last month. \"So, you'd always like to have the horse at the front of the rotation, there's no question. But it's not the only way to build a rotation, it's not the only way to win a playoff series, it's not the only way to win a World Series.\" The moves have so far yielded mixed results. The Mets' rotation led the majors with a 2.84 ERA and ranked 14th in innings pitched through June 7, when they were 41-24 and led the NL East by 31⁄2 games. Since then, Mets starters rank 24th in ERA (4.74) and 28th in innings pitched. The club has a 22-27 record during the stretch and now trails the Philadelphia Phillies by 21⁄2 games in the division. 'He turned his back on us' What it was like watching Juan Soto's Bronx return with the Bleacher Creatures. Jorge Castillo » Injuries have played a factor in the drop-off, with four starters landing on the injured list in June. Kodai Senga , who signed a five-year, $75 million deal in 2022 -- a year before Stearns' arrival in Queens -- strained his hamstring and sat out nearly a month. Canning had been a strong contributor until a ruptured left Achilles tendon ended his season, and Tylor Megill (elbow) and Paul Blackburn (shoulder) are still working their way back. Manaea, who began the season on the IL, has made only five starts since his return last month, the most recent Monday against the Cleveland Guardians , when he dominated for five innings before surrendering five runs in the sixth. Montas, who has posted a ghastly 6.68 ERA in seven starts, is in danger of losing his rotation spot when Blackburn and Megill are activated. Holmes, meanwhile, hasn't logged more than 51⁄3 innings in a start since June 7 against the Colorado Rockies , and has already doubled his previous career high for innings in a season. And Senga yielded four runs over four innings Saturday, marking the fourth straight start he has failed to pitch into the sixth. \"We haven't gotten consistency out of the starting pitching,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said Monday. \"I think that's where it starts every night. It starts on the mound and we haven't been able to get some quality starts.\" One of Sproat and McLean, if not both, could soon get the call to help. McLean has a 2.81 ERA in 15 games (12 starts) for Triple-A Syracuse after posting a 1.37 ERA in five games for Double-A Binghamton to begin the season. Sproat has emerged from early season struggles with a dominant stretch for Syracuse, holding opponents to two earned runs in 33 innings over his past six starts. The two 24-year-old right-handers, both drafted and developed by the Mets, have seemingly checked the necessary boxes in the minors. They could give the big league rotation the push it needs for the final stretch. For now, they and the Mets' fanbase wait. Said Stearns: \"I think they're getting close.\"",

The Mets have instead focused on strengthening their bullpen and considering internal promotions for promising Triple-A players like Brandon Sproat and Nolan McLean.",
      "ai_content": "In a strategic decision aimed at maintaining financial prudence, David Stearns, President of Baseball Operations for the New York Mets, stood firm against the temptation to overpay for a starting pitcher as the trade deadline approached. Despite mounting calls from fans eager to see improvements in the Mets' struggling starting rotation—highlighted by the fact that only David Peterson had logged at least six innings in a game over the previous month—the Mets opted to reinforce other areas of their squad.\nStearns engaged with several teams regarding potential acquisitions of starting pitchers, even reaching out to Washington Nationals' All-Star left-hander MacKenzie Gore. However, he ultimately decided that the cost would outweigh the benefits. In contrast to many other contenders who splurged on established stars, Stearns adhered to a core principle of his approach to roster construction: avoiding excessive expenditure on elite major league starters.\nThe Mets' strategy involved bolstering their already-taxed bullpen with three top-tier relievers—Ryan Helsley, Tyler Rogers, and Gregory Soto—and adding veteran talent through Cedric Mullins, which improved their offensive capabilities. Meanwhile, discussions continued around internally promoted prospects such as Brandon Sproat and Nolan McLean, who have shown exceptional promise in Triple-A.\nAs the season progresses, Stearns remains cautious yet optimistic about integrating these young talents into the Mets' rotation if they reach the appropriate stage of readiness. This measured approach reflects a broader trend among some franchises prioritizing long-term sustainability over short-term gains—a choice that could prove pivotal in shaping the future success of the franchise.",

Real Estate Management Services revenue growth was driven by continued strong performance in Workplace Management, with client wins slightly outpacing mandate expansions, as incremental pass-through costs augmented high single-digit management fee growth. Higher Project Management revenue was led by new or expanded contracts in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, as a mid-teens management fee increase was supplemented by higher pass-through costs.The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and margin was primarily attributable to the top-line performance described above, coupled with continued cost discipline. These drivers overcame headwinds from the favorable prior-year impact of incentive compensation accruals timing.Leasing Advisory Second-Quarter 2025 Performance Highlights:Leasing Advisory($ in millions, \"LC\" = local currency)Three Months Ended June 30,% Change in USD% Change in LCSix Months Ended June 30,% Change in USD% Change in LC2025202420252024Revenue$ 676.8$ 642.25 %5 %$ 1,262.9$ 1,162.69 %9 %Leasing651.5619.1551,217.61,116.499Advisory, Consulting and Other25.323.110845.346.2(2)(2)Segment operating expenses$ 567.8$ 539.35 %5 %$ 1,069.0$ 994.28 %8 %Segment platform operating expenses564.5531.0661,063.7979.599Gross contract costs63.38.3(60)(60)5.314.7(64)(64)Adjusted EBITDA1$ 120.4$ 112.17 %6 %$ 217.4$ 186.916 %15 %Note: For discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see the Notes following the Financial Statements in this news release. Percentage variances in the Performance Highlights below are calculated and presented on a local currency basis, unless otherwise noted. Compared with the prior-year quarter, increased revenue was driven by Leasing growth across major asset classes, led by continued momentum in industrial and office. Geographically, Leasing revenue grew most significantly in the United States, with notable contributions from France, Australia and Singapore. The U.S. was primarily driven by growth in industrial, both from higher volume and deal size, while a notable increase in deal size for U.S. office was largely offset by lower volume as the asset class was up low single digits. With the backdrop of decelerating growth in the broader market, Leasing performed in line with global office volumes and outperformed U.S. office volumes (decline of 3%) in the second quarter, according to JLL Research.The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and margin were largely driven by the revenue growth described above, tempered by discrete, variable operating expenses in the second quarter as compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of revenue improved year-over-year for the quarter (enabled by increased use of technology and shared service centers).Capital Markets Services Second-Quarter 2025 Performance Highlights:Capital Markets Services($ in millions, \"LC\" = local currency)Three Months Ended June 30,% Change in USD% Change in LCSix Months Ended June 30,% Change in USD% Change in LC2025202420252024Revenue$ 520.3$ 457.614 %12 %$ 955.6$ 835.214 %14 %Investment Sales, Debt/Equity Advisory and Other, excluding Net non-cash MSR384.8332.11614710.3599.81818Net non-cash MSR and mortgage banking derivative activity(4.2)(11.8)6464(17.1)(20.8)1818Value and Risk Advisory97.795.82—179.3176.022Loan Servicing42.041.51183.180.244Segment operating expenses$ 488.3$ 453.58 %6 %$ 908.5$ 831.99 %9 %Segment platform operating expenses486.6441.7109905.7806.51212Gross contract costs61.711.8(86)(85)2.825.4(89)(89)Adjusted EBITDA1$ 54.7$ 33.862 %61 %$ 103.3$ 58.876 %73 %Note: For discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see the Notes following the Financial Statements in this news release.

Capital Markets Services top-line growth was fueled by debt advisory and investment sales. The residential sector delivered the most significant contribution to the year-over-year increase, with notable contributions also coming from the office, industrial and retail sectors. Geographically, the U.S., Japan and MENA2 led the revenue growth.In the current quarter, the company recognized approximately $14.0 million of incremental expense associated with an enhanced loss-share agreement with Fannie Mae for a specific three-loan portfolio. The impact of this item on year-over-year performance is more than offset by the $18.0 million expense recognized in the prior-year quarter associated with the August 2024 repurchase of a loan which JLL originated and then sold to Fannie Mae.Adjusted EBITDA and margin improvements for the quarter were primarily attributable to the revenue growth described above and the net impact of year-over-year loan-related losses. In addition, compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue modestly improved year-over-year for the second quarter (enabled by increased use of technology and shared service centers).Investment Management Second-Quarter 2025 Performance Highlights:Investment Management($ in millions, \"LC\" = local currency)Three Months Ended June 30,% Change in USD% Change in LCSix Months Ended June 30,% Change in USD% Change in LC2025202420252024Revenue$ 103.1$ 102.6— %(2) %$ 201.6$ 206.0(2) %(3) %Advisory fees93.393.1—(2)182.6185.4(2)(2)Transaction fees and other6.56.9(6)(9)15.015.8(5)(6)Incentive fees3.32.627244.04.8(17)(19)Segment operating expenses$ 89.5$ 90.3(1) %(3) %$ 175.2$ 174.9— %— %Segment platform operating expenses81.281.5—(3)158.7157.71—Gross contract costs68.38.8(6)(5)16.517.2(4)(4)Adjusted EBITDA1Full story available on Benzinga.com",

Percentage variances in the Performance Highlights below are calculated and presented on a local currency basis, unless otherwise noted. Real Estate Management Services revenue growth was driven by continued strong performance in Workplace Management, with client wins slightly outpacing mandate expansions, as incremental pass-through costs augmented high single-digit management fee growth. Higher Project Management revenue was led by new or expanded contracts in the U.S. and Asia Pacific , as a mid-teens management fee increase was supplemented by higher pass-through costs. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and margin was primarily attributable to the top-line performance described above, coupled with continued cost discipline. These drivers overcame headwinds from the favorable prior-year impact of incentive compensation accruals timing.

Percentage variances in the Performance Highlights below are calculated and presented on a local currency basis, unless otherwise noted. Compared with the prior-year quarter, increased revenue was driven by Leasing growth across major asset classes, led by continued momentum in industrial and office. Geographically, Leasing revenue grew most significantly in the United States , with notable contributions from France , Australia and Singapore . The U.S. was primarily driven by growth in industrial, both from higher volume and deal size, while a notable increase in deal size for U.S. office was largely offset by lower volume as the asset class was up low single digits. With the backdrop of decelerating growth in the broader market, Leasing performed in line with global office volumes and outperformed U.S. office volumes (decline of 3%) in the second quarter, according to JLL Research. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and margin were largely driven by the revenue growth described above, tempered by discrete, variable operating expenses in the second quarter as compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of revenue improved year-over-year for the quarter (enabled by increased use of technology and shared service centers). Capital Markets Services Second-Quarter 2025 Performance Highlights: Capital Markets Services ($ in millions, \"LC\" = local currency) Three Months Ended June 30, % Change in USD % Change in LC Six Months Ended June 30, % Change in USD % Change in LC 2025 2024 2025 2024 Revenue $ 520.3 $ 457.6 14 % 12 % $ 955.6 $ 835.2 14 % 14 % Investment Sales, Debt/Equity Advisory and Other, excluding Net non-cash MSR 384.8 332.1 16 14 710.3 599.8 18 18 Net non-cash MSR and mortgage banking derivative activity (4.2) (11.8) 64 64 (17.1) (20.8) 18 18 Value and Risk Advisory 97.7 95.8 2 — 179.3 176.0 2 2 Loan Servicing 42.0 41.5 1 1 83.1 80.2 4 4 Segment operating expenses $ 488.3 $ 453.5 8 % 6 % $ 908.5 $ 831.9 9 % 9 % Segment platform operating expenses 486.6 441.7 10 9 905.7 806.5 12 12 Gross contract costs 6 1.7 11.8 (86) (85) 2.8 25.4 (89) (89) Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 54.7 $ 33.8 62 % 61 % $ 103.3 $ 58.8 76 % 73 % Note: For discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see the Notes following the Financial Statements in this news release. Percentage variances in the Performance Highlights below are calculated and presented on a local currency basis, unless otherwise noted. Capital Markets Services top-line growth was fueled by debt advisory and investment sales. The residential sector delivered the most significant contribution to the year-over-year increase, with notable contributions also coming from the office, industrial and retail sectors. Geographically, the U.S., Japan and MENA 2 led the revenue growth. In the current quarter, the company recognized approximately $14.0 million of incremental expense associated with an enhanced loss-share agreement with Fannie Mae for a specific three-loan portfolio. The impact of this item on year-over-year performance is more than offset by the $18.0 million expense recognized in the prior-year quarter associated with the August 2024 repurchase of a loan which JLL originated and then sold to Fannie Mae. Adjusted EBITDA and margin improvements for the quarter were primarily attributable to the revenue growth described above and the net impact of year-over-year loan-related losses. In addition, compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue modestly improved year-over-year for the second quarter (enabled by increased use of technology and shared service centers).

Percentage variances in the Performance Highlights below are calculated and presented on a local currency basis, unless otherwise noted. The slight decline in Investment Management advisory fees was primarily due to lower assets under management (\"AUM\"), continuing to reflect asset dispositions on behalf of certain clients in the fourth quarter of 2024. The changes in Adjusted EBITDA and margin were largely driven by the absence of the $8.2 million gain recognized in the prior-year quarter following the purchase of a controlling interest in a fund managed by the company. AUM 3 increased 3% in USD (2% in local currency) during the quarter, and decreased 2% in USD and local currency over the trailing twelve months.

Percentage variances in the Performance Highlights below are calculated and presented on a local currency basis, unless otherwise noted. (a) Carried interest expense/benefit is associated with equity earnings/losses on Spark Venture Funds investments. Lower Software and Technology Solutions revenue was primarily due to reduced technology spend from certain large existing clients, partially offset by low double-digit growth in software services. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the favorable change in carried interest expense/benefit.

JONES LANG LASALLE INCORPORATED Financial Statement Notes 1. Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to develop budgets and forecasts, measure and reward performance against those budgets and forecasts, and enhance comparability to prior periods. These measures are believed to be useful to investors and other external stakeholders as supplemental measures of core operating performance and include the following: (i) Adjusted EBITDA attributable to common shareholders (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), (ii) Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and Adjusted diluted earnings per share, (iii) Free Cash Flow (refer to Note 6), (iv) Net Debt (refer to Note 6) and (v) Percentage changes against prior periods, presented on a local currency basis. However, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Any measure that eliminates components of a company's capital structure, cost of operations or investments, or other results has limitations as a performance measure. In light of these limitations, management also considers GAAP financial measures and does not rely solely on non-GAAP financial measures. Because the company's non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjustments to GAAP Financial Measures Used to Calculate non-GAAP Financial Measures Net Non-Cash Mortgage Servicing Rights (\"MSR\") and Mortgage Banking Derivative Activity consists of the balances presented within Revenue composed of (i) derivative gains/losses resulting from mortgage banking loan commitment and warehousing activity and (ii) gains recognized from the retention of MSR upon origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by (iii) amortization of MSR intangible assets over the period that net servicing income is projected to be received. Non-cash derivative gains/losses resulting from mortgage banking loan commitment and warehousing activity are calculated as the estimated fair value of loan commitments and subsequent changes thereof, primarily represented by the estimated net cash flows associated with future servicing rights. MSR gains and corresponding MSR intangible assets are calculated as the present value of estimated cash flows over the estimated mortgage servicing periods. The above activity is reported entirely within Revenue of the Capital Markets Services segment. Excluding net non-cash MSR and mortgage banking derivative activity reflects how the company manages and evaluates performance because the excluded activity is non-cash in nature. Restructuring and Acquisition Charges primarily consist of: (i) severance and employment-related charges, including those related to external service providers, incurred in conjunction with a structural business shift, which can be represented by a notable change in headcount, change in leadership or transformation of business processes; (ii) acquisition, transaction and integration-related charges, including fair value adjustments, which are generally non-cash in the periods such adjustments are made, to assets and liabilities recorded in purchase accounting such as earn-out liabilities and intangible assets; and (iii) lease exit charges. Such activity is excluded as the amounts are generally either non-cash in nature or the anticipated benefits from the expenditures would not likely be fully realized until future periods. Restructuring and acquisition charges are excluded from segment operating results and therefore are not line items in the segments' reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA. Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles is primarily associated with the fair value ascribed at closing of an acquisition to assets such as acquired management contracts, customer backlog and relationships, and trade name. Such activity is excluded as it is non-cash and the change in period-over-period activity is generally the result of longer-term strategic decisions and therefore not necessarily indicative of core operating results. Gain or Loss on Disposition reflects the gain or loss recognized on the sale of businesses. Given the low frequency of business disposals by the company historically, the gain or loss directly associated with such activity is excluded as it is not considered indicative of core operating performance. Interest on Employee Loans, Net of Forgiveness reflects interest accrued on employee loans less the amount of accrued interest forgiven. Certain employees (predominantly in Leasing Advisory and Capital Markets Services businesses) receive cash payments structured as loans, with interest. Employees earn forgiveness of the loan based on performance, generally calculated as a percentage of revenue production. Such forgiven amounts are reflected in Compensation and benefits expense. Given the interest accrued on these employee loans and subsequent forgiveness are non-cash and the amounts perfectly offset over the life of the loan, the activity is not indicative of core operating performance and is excluded from non-GAAP measures. Equity Earnings/Losses (Investment Management and Software and Technology Solutions) primarily reflects valuation changes on investments reported at fair value. Investments reported at fair value are increased or decreased each reporting period by the change in the fair value of the investment. Where the measurement alternative has been elected, our investment is increased or decreased upon observable price changes. Such activity is excluded as the amounts are generally non‐cash in nature and not indicative of core operating performance. Note: Equity earnings/losses in the remaining segments represent the results of unconsolidated operating ventures (not investments), and therefore the amounts are included in adjusted profit measures on both a segment and consolidated basis. Credit Losses on Convertible Note Investments reflects credit impairments associated with pre-equity convertible note investments in early-stage proptech enterprises. Such losses are similar to the equity investment-related losses included in equity earnings/losses for Software and Technology Solutions' investments and are therefore consistently excluded from adjusted measures. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Below are (i) a reconciliation of Net income attributable to common shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) a reconciliation to Adjusted net income and (iii) components of Adjusted diluted earnings per share.

(b) For the first half of 2025 and 2024, the tax impact of adjusted items was calculated using the applicable statutory rates by tax jurisdiction. Operating Results - Local Currency In discussing operating results, the company refers to percentage changes in local currency, unless otherwise noted. Amounts presented on a local currency basis are calculated by translating the current period results of foreign operations to U.S. dollars using the foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period. Management believes this methodology provides a framework for assessing performance and operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. The following table reflects the reconciliation to local currency amounts for consolidated (i) Revenue, (ii) Operating income and (iii) Adjusted EBITDA.

In addition, Investment Management raised $1.0 billion in private equity capital for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 , bringing the year-to-date raised capital to $2.9 billion . 4. The company defines \"Resilient\" revenue as (i) Workplace Management, Project Management and Property Management, within Real Estate Management Services, (ii) Value and Risk Advisory, and Loan Servicing, within Capital Markets Services, (iii) Advisory Fees, within Investment Management and (iv) Software and Technology Solutions. The company defines \"Transactional\" revenue as (i) Portfolio Services and Other, within Real Estate Management Services, (ii) Leasing Advisory, (iii) Investment Sales, Debt/Equity Advisory and Other, within Capital Markets Services, and (iv) Incentive fees and Transaction fees and other, within Investment Management. Effective beginning Q1 2025, the company reports Project Management in Resilient revenue. Prior period financial information was recast to conform with this presentation. 5. Restructuring and acquisition charges are excluded from the company's measure of segment operating results, although they are included within consolidated Operating income. For purposes of segment operating results, the allocation of Restructuring and acquisition charges to the segments is not a component of management's assessment of segment performance.

      "ai_content": "In a recent press release dated August 6, 2025, Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL), disclosed their robust financial outcomes for the second quarter of 2025. The corporation celebrated a significant milestone with a record-breaking five straight quarters of double-digit revenue expansion alongside a notable 32% surge in diluted earnings per share (EPS). For the period ending June 30, 2025, JLL posted a revenue figure of $6.3 billion, marking a 10% increment when measured against prior periods. This upward trajectory was propelled primarily by gains in both Resilient and Transactional sectors, which have each enjoyed no less than six successive quarters of advancement.\nDelving deeper into the numbers, Resilient revenues climbed by 11%, whereas Transactional revenues advanced by 7%. In parallel, Real Estate Management Services witnessed an 11% uptick, largely attributed to enhancements in Project Management and Workplace Management initiatives. Capital Markets Services were not left behind either; they experienced a 12% boost, thanks mainly to the thriving debt advisory and investment sales divisions.\nWithin the realm of leasing activities under Leasing Advisory, there was a modest yet positive shift of 5%, underscored by developments in industrial leases in the United States and office spaces spanning the US and Asia Pacific regions.\nChristian Ulbrich, President and CEO of JLL, lauded these achievements stating that such formidable increases in profitability mirror not only revenue augmentation but also refined operational efficiencies stemming from better platform utilization coupled with steadfast cost control measures. He further emphasized the company's dedication towards client support amidst fluctuating market conditions through substantial reinvestments in human resources and technological infrastructure—strategies he believes will foster enduring growth and heightened productivity, particularly within resilience-focused enterprises.\nMoreover, JLL has demonstrated fiscal prudence via doubling down on share buybacks during the second quarter—a move indicative of confidence in the firm's current standing and future prospects. With regard to long-term objectives, Ulbrich revealed an elevation in the midpoint estimate for the full-year Adjusted EBITDA target range, reflecting optimism about sustained progress throughout the remainder of the calendar year.",

Anuj has stepped down from the Arbutus Board in order to focus exclusively on this new role, and on behalf of the Company and the entire Board, I thank Anuj for his service. We are also excited to welcome Dr. Roger Sawhney as the newest member of our Board. Dr. Sawhney has enjoyed a distinguished career spanning senior executive roles in biotech, pharma and investing, and also brings extensive public company board experience.” LNP Litigation Arbutus continues to consult closely with and support our exclusive licensee, Genevant Sciences, to protect and defend Arbutus’s intellectual property, which is the subject of on-going lawsuits against Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. The Company, together with Genevant, is seeking fair compensation for Moderna’s and Pfizer/BioNTech’s use of Arbutus’s patented LNP technology that was developed with great effort and at a great expense, and without which Moderna’s and Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccines would not have been successful. In the Moderna U.S. litigation, fact discovery has been completed, and expert discovery is concluding. The summary judgment phase of the case began in July 2025 and a jury trial is scheduled to be held in March 2026. Additionally, in July 2025, the case was reassigned to a different judge in the same court. In March 2025, the Company, alongside Genevant Sciences, filed five international lawsuits against Moderna and its affiliates seeking to enforce patents protecting the Company’s patented LNP technology across 30 countries. The first major hearings in the international lawsuits are expected in the first half of calendar year 2026. The claim construction hearing for the lawsuit against Pfizer/BioNTech occurred in December 2024. The court has not provided guidance for the timing of its ruling in the claim construction hearing, which could potentially come in 2025. Corporate Updates In June 2025, the Company and Qilu Pharmaceutical mutually agreed to conclude the strategic partnership for the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of imdusiran in Greater China. The Company now once again holds global rights for its lead compound, imdusiran. Dr. Harry L.A. Janssen, MD, PhD, joined the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board effective August 1, 2025, increasing the membership to six global experts in cHBV treatment. Dr. Janssen is a Professor of Hepatology and the Chair of the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Effective August 4, 2025, Anuj Hasija resigned from the Company’s Board of Directors due to his transition to a full-time executive role that precludes his participation on the Arbutus and other boards of directors. Filling the vacancy on our Board of Directors, Dr. Roger Sawhney, MD, joined the Board effective August 4, 2025. Dr. Sawhney is a seasoned executive and board member with extensive experience across biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, healthcare technology, and investment sectors. He holds an MD from Harvard Medical School and a BA in Economics from Stanford University. Financial Results Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments As of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of $98.1 million compared to $122.6 million as of December 31, 2024. During the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company used $29.1 million in operating activities, which included one-time payments related to our restructuring efforts. This was partially offset by $3.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. Revenue Total revenue was $10.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2024. The increase of $9.0 million was primarily due to the recognition of all previously-deferred revenue as a result of the conclusion of the Company’s strategic partnership with Qilu Pharmaceutical, partially offset by a decrease in license royalty revenues due to a decline in Alnylam’s sales of ONPATTRO. Operating Expenses Research and development expenses were $5.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $10.1 million was due primarily to cost savings from the Company’s decision in August 2024 to streamline the organization to focus its efforts on advancing the clinical development of imdusiran and AB-101, which included ceasing all discovery efforts, discontinuing its IM-PROVE III clinical trial and reducing the Company’s workforce. General and administrative expenses were $3.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2024. This decrease was due primarily to cost cutting efforts by the Company, which drove reductions in litigation-related legal fees and employee compensation-related expenses. Restructuring costs in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 were $0.2 million, and all remaining restructuring-related payments are expected to be made in the second half of 2025. Net Income/Loss For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, the Company’s net income was $2.5 million, or income of $0.01 per basic and diluted common share, as compared to a net loss of $19.8 million, or a loss of $0.11 per basic and diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Outstanding Shares As of June 30, 2025, the Company had 191.6 million common shares issued and outstanding, as well as 15.2 million stock options and unvested restricted stock units outstanding. About Imdusiran (AB-729) Imdusiran is an RNAi therapeutic specifically designed to reduce all hepatitis B viral proteins and antigens including HBsAg, which is thought to be a key prerequisite to enable reawakening of a patient’s immune system to control the virus. Imdusiran targets hepatocytes using Arbutus’ novel covalently conjugated N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) delivery technology enabling subcutaneous delivery. To date, Arbutus has reported a total of eight patients with cHBV who have achieved a functional cure following treatment with imdusiran and NA therapy in combination with either IFN or low dose nivolumab plus an immunotherapeutic. Clinical data generated thus far has shown imdusiran to be generally safe and well-tolerated, while also providing meaningful reductions in HBsAg and hepatitis B virus DNA. About HBV Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV can cause chronic infection which leads to a higher risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. cHBV infection represents a significant unmet medical need. The World Health Organization estimates that over 250 million people worldwide suffer from cHBV infection, while other estimates indicate that approximately 2 million people in the United States suffer from cHBV infection. Approximately 1.1 million people die every year from complications related to cHBV infection despite the availability of effective vaccines and current treatment options. About Arbutus Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on infectious disease. The company is currently developing imdusiran (AB-729) and an oral PD-L1 inhibitor (AB-101) for the treatment of cHBV infection. The Company is also consulting closely with and supporting its exclusive licensee, Genevant Sciences, to protect and defend its intellectual property, which is the subject of on-going lawsuits against Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech for use of Arbutus’s patented LNP technology in their COVID-19 vaccines.

      "ai_content": "In a recent press release dated August 6, 2025, Arbutus Biopharma Corporation disclosed its financial performance for the second quarter of 2025 alongside updates on corporate governance changes. The company's total revenue reached $10.7 million during this period, reflecting growth attributed to the strategic acquisition of greater Chinese rights to the drug imdusiran. This move followed the resolution of previous deferred revenues associated with these rights.\nLindsay Androski, President and CEO of Arbutus, expressed satisfaction with the quarter's outcomes, highlighting it as another successful step towards enhancing shareholder value via their chronic hepatitis B virus (cHBV) initiatives. A significant development within the company's leadership occurred when Dr. Harry Janssen, renowned for his expertise in late-stage clinical trials concerning cHBV, became part of the Scientific Advisory Board. His addition underscores Arbutus's commitment to advancing research and treatment options for patients affected by cHBV.\nThe announcement further noted the transition of Anuj Hasija from serving on the Arbutus Board to assuming the role of Vice President, Global Commercial Strategy for Type 1 Diabetes at Vertex Pharmaceuticals. In recognition of his contributions, Arbutus extended gratitude toward Mr. Hasija for his dedicated service. Additionally, the company welcomed Dr. Roger Sawhney into its Board of Directors—a seasoned professional whose background spans across biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, investment sectors, and public company boards—further strengthening the organization's decision-making framework.\nAmidst these developments, Arbutus remains vigilant in protecting its intellectual property interests. The corporation collaborates intimately with Genevant Sciences—the sole licensee—to address legal challenges posed by ongoing litigations involving major pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. These efforts aim to secure just remuneration for the utilization of Arbutus's proprietary technologies by these entities.",

Imdusiran targets hepatocytes using Arbutus' novel covalently conjugated N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) delivery technology enabling subcutaneous delivery. To date, Arbutus has reported a total of eight patients with cHBV who have achieved a functional cure following treatment with imdusiran and NA therapy in combination with either IFN or low dose nivolumab plus an immunotherapeutic. Clinical data generated thus far has shown imdusiran to be generally safe and well-tolerated, while also providing meaningful reductions in HBsAg and hepatitis B virus DNA. About HBV Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV can cause chronic infection which leads to a higher risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. cHBV infection represents a significant unmet medical need. The World Health Organization estimates that over 250 million people worldwide suffer from cHBV infection, while other estimates indicate that approximately 2 million people in the United States suffer from cHBV infection. Approximately 1.1 million people die every year from complications related to cHBV infection despite the availability of effective vaccines and current treatment options. About Arbutus Arbutus Biopharma Corporation ABUS is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on infectious disease. The company is currently developing imdusiran (AB-729) and an oral PD-L1 inhibitor (AB-101) for the treatment of cHBV infection. The Company is also consulting closely with and supporting its exclusive licensee, Genevant Sciences, to protect and defend its intellectual property, which is the subject of on-going lawsuits against Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech for use of Arbutus's patented LNP technology in their COVID-19 vaccines.

Forward-Looking Statements and Information This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws (collectively, forward-looking statements). Forward-looking statements in this press release include statements about: the potential to lead to a functional cure for HBV; the potential for Arbutus' product candidates to achieve success in clinical trials; Arbutus' pipeline and development plans for its cHBV programs; and Arbutus' plans with respect to the ongoing patent litigation matters, and the expected timing thereof. With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, Arbutus has made numerous assumptions regarding, among other things: the effectiveness and timeliness of clinical trials, and the usefulness of the data; the continued demand for Arbutus' assets; and the stability of economic and market conditions. While Arbutus considers these assumptions to be reasonable, these assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, market and social uncertainties and contingencies. Additionally, there are known and unknown risk factors which could cause Arbutus' actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein. Known risk factors include, among others: ongoing and anticipated clinical trials may be more costly or take longer to complete than anticipated, and may never be initiated or completed, or may not generate results that warrant future development of the tested product candidate; Arbutus may elect to change its strategy regarding its product candidates and clinical development activities; Arbutus may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals for the clinical development of Arbutus' product candidates; uncertainties associated with litigation generally and patent litigation specifically; economic and market conditions may worsen; market shifts may require a change in strategic focus; Arbutus' workforce reduction and plans to reduce its net cash burn may not materially extend the cash runway and may create a distraction or uncertainty that may adversely affect its operating results, business, or investor perceptions; and risks related to the sufficiency of Arbutus' cash resources for its foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditures. A more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing Arbutus appears in Arbutus' Annual Report on Form 10-K, Arbutus' Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Arbutus' continuous and periodic disclosure filings, which are available at www.sedar.com and at www.sec.gov . All forward-looking statements herein are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement, and Arbutus disclaims any obligation to revise or update any such forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future results, events or developments, except as required by law.

      "ai_content": "In a recent press release, Arbutus Biopharma Corporation disclosed its robust performance during the second quarter of 2025, reporting a total revenue of $10.7 million attributed to the strategic acquisition of greater China rights related to imdusiran. This move underscores the company's commitment to expanding its portfolio within the realm of infectious diseases, particularly those affecting liver health such as chronic hepatitis B virus (cHBV).\nThe announcement came alongside significant changes in leadership positions within the corporation. Dr. Roger Sawhney, known for his extensive background in biotechnology, pharmaceutical industries, and investment sectors, has been appointed to the Arbutus Board of Directors. His expertise promises to bolster the company's governance structure significantly.\nConcurrently, Anuj Hasija resigned from his role on the Arbutus Board to assume the newly created position of Vice President, Global Commercial Strategy for Type 1 Diabetes at Vertex Pharmaceuticals. In recognition of his contributions, Arbutus expressed gratitude towards Mr. Hasija for his dedicated service.\nAdding further strength to Arbutus's scientific advisory team, Dr. Harry Janssen from Erasmus MC in Rotterdam has joined the Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Janssen's involvement signals a deepening collaboration aimed at advancing clinical research efforts centered around cHBV treatments.\nAmidst these developments, Arbutus remains vigilant in protecting its proprietary interests. The company continues to work closely with Genevant Sciences—the exclusive licensee—to address legal challenges posed by ongoing litigations involving major players Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. These disputes revolve around allegations concerning the unauthorized utilization of Arbutus's innovative lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology—a cornerstone innovation initially conceived under considerable effort and substantial expenditure.",

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)The conservative’s abrupt and poorly planned power grab on Dec. 3 came during a seemingly routine standoff with the liberals, whom he described as “anti-state” forces abusing their legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. Some political opponents have questioned whether Yoon’s actions were at least partly motivated by growing allegations against his wife, which hurt his approval ratings and gave political ammunition to his rivals.“I apologize for causing concern to the people, even though I am someone insignificant,” Kim told reporters as she arrived for questioning. She added that she would sincerely cooperate with the investigation, before walking away without responding to specific questions about the allegations.The team of investigators led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki said Kim was questioned for about seven hours until Wednesday afternoon, but they didn’t specify whether she will be summoned again. Investigators said they haven’t decided whether they would seek her arrest.Through a heavy police presence, dozens of Yoon’s supporters gathered outside the special prosecutor’s office in downtown Seoul, waving South Korean and U.S. flags and banners in light rain.Yoon, who was sent back to prison last month and faces a high-stakes trial on rebellion and other charges, resisted an attempt by investigators last week to compel him for questioning over his wife.

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Wednesday is the 60th anniversary of the day President Lyndon Johnson made his way to the U.S. Capitol and, with Martin Luther King Jr. standing behind him, signed the Voting Rights Act into law. The act protected the right to vote and ensured the government would fight efforts to suppress it, especially those aimed at Black voters. For many Americans, it was the day U.S. democracy fully began . That was then. The law has been slowly eroding for more than a decade, starting with the 2013 Supreme Court decision ending the requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. Within hours of the ruling , some states that had been under the preclearance provision began announcing plans for stricter voting laws. Those changes have continued, especially since the 2020 presidential election and President Donald Trump's false claims that widespread fraud cost him reelection. The Supreme Court upheld a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, but in its upcoming term it's scheduled to hear a case that could roll back that decision and another that would effectively neuter the law. Voting rights experts say those cases will largely determine whether a landmark law passed during a turbulent era decades ago will have future anniversaries to mark. “We’re at a critical juncture right now,\" said Demetria McCain, director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \"And, let’s be clear, our democracy is only about to turn 60 when the Voting Rights Act anniversary gets here. I say that because there are so many attacks on voting rights, particularly as it relates to Black communities and communities of color.\" Native Americans celebrate a win that could be temporary The reservation of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Canadian border, a region of forests, small lakes and vast prairie land. Its main highway is a mix of small houses, mobile homes and businesses. A gleaming casino and hotel stand out, not far from grazing bison. In 2024, the tribe and another in North Dakota, the Spirit Lake Tribe, formed a joint political district for the first time. They had filed a lawsuit arguing that the way lines were drawn for state legislative seats denied them the right to elect candidates of their choice. U.S. District Court Chief Judge Peter Welte agreed and put a new map in place . State Rep. Collette Brown ran for the legislature because she wanted to see more Native American representation, and she won under the new map. “It felt surreal. I felt accomplished, I felt recognized,\" said Brown, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and the Spirit Lake Tribe’s Gaming Commission executive director. “I felt, OK, it’s time for us to really start making change and really start educating from within so that we’re not silenced.” Brown, a Democrat, co-sponsored several bills on Native American issues that became law, including aid for repatriation of remains and artifacts and alerts for missing Indigenous people. This year's anniversary of the Voting Rights Act “forces you to look at how far we’ve come,” from Native Americans to women, said Jamie Azure, chairman of the Turtle Mountain tribe. Now the future of their district is in the hands of the Supreme Court. Will individuals be allowed to file voting rights challenges? The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals , which covers North Dakota and six other states, overturned Welte's decision 2-1 , saying the tribes and entities such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the ACLU do not have a right to sue over potential violations of voters' constitutional rights. That ruling expanded on an earlier 8th Circuit opinion out of Arkansas that rejected a different challenge on the same grounds. Late last month, a 3rd Circuit court panel ruled in a separate case out of Arkansas that only the U.S. attorney general can file such cases — not private individuals or groups. Those decisions upended decades of precedent. The Supreme Court has stayed the ruling for the tribes while it decides whether it will take the North Dakota case. The University of Michigan Law School Voting Rights Initiative found that since 1982 nearly 87% of claims under that part of the Voting Rights Act, known as Section 2, were from private individuals and organizations. Leaving individuals without the ability to file challenges is especially troublesome now because the Justice Department under Trump, a Republican, seems focused on other priorities, said Sophia Lin Lakin, who heads the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. The government’s voting rights unit has been dismantled and given new priorities that, she said, have turned enforcement “against the very people it was created to protect .\" The Justice Department declined to answer questions about its voting rights priorities, cases it is pursuing or whether it would be involved in the voting rights cases coming before the nation's highest court. Supreme Court weighs another case on race and congressional districts Two years ago, voting rights activists celebrated when the Supreme Court preserved Section 2 in a case out of Alabama that required the state to draw an addition congressional district to benefit Black voters. Now it's poised to rehear a similar case out of Louisiana that could modify or undo that decision. The court heard the case in March but did not make a decision during the term. In an order on Friday, the court asked the lawyers to supply briefs explaining “whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution.” Robert Weiner, the director of voting rights for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said while it is a “matter of concern” that the court is asking the question, the fact the nine justices did not reach a decision during the last term suggests there weren’t five votes already. “They wouldn’t need re-argument if the sides had already been chosen,“ he said. Trump's Justice Department shifts focus on voting issues At a time when the remaining protections of the Voting Rights Act are under threat, the Justice Department has shifted its election-related priorities. Under Attorney General Pam Bondi , it has dropped or withdrawn from several election- and voting-related cases. The department instead has focused on concerns of voter fraud raised by conservative activists following years of false claims surrounding elections. The department also has sent requests for voter registration information as well as data on election fraud and warnings of election violations to at least 19 states. In addition to the shift in focus at the Justice Department, federal legislation to protect voting rights has gone nowhere. Democrats have reintroduced the John Lewis voting rights bill , but it's legislation they failed to pass in 2022 when they held both houses of Congress and the White House and needed some Republican support in the Senate. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order seeking to overhaul voting in the states, which includes a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement on the federal voting form, though much of it has been blocked in the courts. The GOP-controlled House passed a bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. And gerrymandering state legislative and congressional districts remains prevalent. The slow chipping away at the 60-year-old law has created a nation with an unequal distribution of voting rights, said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights center at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Some states have been active in expanding access to voting while others have been focused on restricting the vote . “The last five to 10 years,\" he said, “the experiences of voters increasingly depend on where they live.” ___ Dura reported from Belcourt, N.D.

      "ai_summary": "On the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act, concerns arise as its protections against voter suppression face challenges. Originally enacted to protect minority voters' rights, the Act's strength has waned following a 2013 Supreme Court decision removing the need for certain states to obtain federal approval before altering their electoral processes. This change led to new state-level restrictions on voting, exacerbated after the 2020 election amid unfounded allegations of widespread fraud. Upcoming Supreme Court cases threaten further erosion of the Act's authority, raising fears among civil rights advocates about the future of American democracy and voting equity.",
      "ai_content": "As America commemorates the 60th anniversary of one of its most significant legislative achievements—the Voting Rights Act—concerns mount regarding the durability of its protective measures. Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson alongside civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., the Act represented a monumental step towards ensuring equal access to the ballot box, particularly for African American citizens who faced systemic barriers to voting.\nHowever, nearly two decades later, the once robust safeguards provided by the Act appear increasingly vulnerable. The pivotal moment came in 2013 when the Supreme Court invalidated Section 4(b), which contained the formula determining which jurisdictions required federal oversight prior to implementing changes affecting voting procedures—a practice known as 'preclearance.' This judicial shift allowed several previously covered states to enact restrictive voting laws without first seeking federal consent.\nIn the wake of this decision, numerous states promptly moved forward with legislation designed to tighten voting regulations. These included imposing stringent ID requirements, reducing early voting periods, and purging voter rolls—all measures critics argue disproportionately impact marginalized groups, including racial minorities and economically disadvantaged individuals.\nThe contentious atmosphere around these developments reached a fever pitch post-2020 Presidential Election. Amidst baseless accusations propagated by former President Donald Trump claiming extensive electoral malfeasance, Congress attempted to pass a constitutional amendment restoring full vigor to the Voting Rights Act; however, it failed to secure sufficient support within the Senate.\nDespite such setbacks, hope flickered briefly in March 2023 when the Supreme Court reaffirmed a crucial aspect of the Voting Rights Act through a narrow majority decision. Yet, looming large over this victory were two high-stakes cases set for review in the current court term. One seeks to dismantle the remaining vestiges of Section 5's enforcement mechanism, while another aims to nullify the entire section altogether.\nVoting rights specialists express grave concern that these impending decisions may irrevocably alter—or even extinguish—the legacy of what was once hailed as a cornerstone of democratic equality. As Demetria McCain, Director of Policy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, poignantly remarks, America's commitment to fair and free elections hangs precariously in balance just months away from reaching its six-decade milestone.",

      "content": "Milorad Dodik lost his presidency according to electoral law after an appeals court upheld a six-year political ban last Friday. He plans to stay in office and appeal the decision. Bosnia's electoral authorities stripped Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik of his presidency Wednesday after a state-level appeals chamber upheld a verdict sentencing him to a six-year ban from politics. The late February ruling by the Sarajevo-based Court of BiH over anti-constitutional conduct triggered a prolonged high-tension political crisis in the Western Balkan country that has since simmered down to a steady boil. However, the heat was back on after the court's appeals chamber confirmed the original verdict against Dodik, who holds the office of president of the Republika Srpska (RS), one of Bosnia and Herzegovina's main administrative units. This meant that the Central Electoral Committee, or CIK, had to open the procedure under electoral law of removing him from office and calling snap elections in the RS to fill the vacated position within 90 days. Dodik, who reacted to Wednesday's decision by stating it was \"yet another sh*tshow from Sarajevo\", can appeal the Central Electoral Committee's decision. \"There's no surrender or giving up. Surrender is not an option,\" Dodik said in a post on X. He has vowed to stay on as entity president regardless of CIK's dismissal. His legal representatives have already announced he will also open a separate case against the original ruling in front of the state-level Constitutional Court. It is unclear how long these processes might take. A general election in Bosnia is set for autumn 2026. Meanwhile, Dodik has attempted to rally all Bosnian Serb political actors to stand behind him in defiance of the court decisions. However, the opposition parties have largely refused to do so so far. The EU's diplomatic service (EEAS) spokesperson said last Friday that the Court of BiH's \"verdict is binding and must be respected.\" \"The EU calls on all parties to acknowledge the independence and impartiality of the court, and to respect and uphold its verdict,\" the statement said. In turn, Dodik has received support from Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. Months-long pushback Since February, Dodik has repeatedly rejected the verdict of one year in prison and barred him from politics for six years for going against the decisions of the country's international peace envoy, Christian Schmidt, which constitutes a criminal act. In the RS, he introduced new laws meant to ban the operation of state-level security and judicial institutions in what comprises about half of the Western Balkan country’s territory. The decisions have been temporarily suspended by the state-level Constitutional Court. \"As far as I’m concerned, that verdict doesn’t exist, and it is null and void,\" Dodik told Euronews Serbia in a June interview. Dodik has also continuously questioned the legitimacy of High Representative Schmidt, saying he acted against \"imposed decisions\" by the envoy whose mandate, Dodik claims, contradicts the Dayton Agreement, signed in 1995 to end the war in the country. The agreement brought about the end of the war between the country's three main ethnic groups — Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats — that began in 1992 during the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, deemed as the bloodiest conflict on European soil since World War II. The High Representative is meant to act as the chief arbiter in high-profile disputes and the key figure overseeing the implementation of the deal. The peace agreement, parts of which act as the country's constitution, split the country into two main administrative units, or entities: the Serb-majority RS and the Bosniak-Croat Federation of BiH (FBiH), partially overseen by an umbrella state-level government. Meant to appease the former belligerents, it created a complicated system of checks and balances, said to be the world's most complex democracy. Dodik, who has served in various top roles, including the state-level presidency, for decades, has repeatedly called for the independence of the RS from the rest of Bosnia, fuelling fears of instability. He has been placed under US and British sanctions for his actions, but has had the steady support of Moscow. Test of post-war stability Dodik's ongoing challenge to the High Representative and state-level institutions' authority has been deemed to be the EU membership hopeful's biggest test of post-war stability. The Court of BiH issued a nationwide arrest warrant for Dodik in March. Since then, he travelled to neighbouring Serbia, Israel and Russia, where he attended the 9 May Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, organised by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Back home, tensions flared up once again in late April after state-level security agency inspectors tried to arrest Dodik, but were prevented from doing so. While the details around the incident remained unclear, domestic media reported that SIPA agents left after “talking” to the RS police. Dodik later said he felt “fine and safe\". The crisis over his potential arrest was somewhat defused in July, when Dodik voluntarily came in for questioning at the state-level prosecutor's office, after which the warrant was dropped. According to Bosnian law, Dodik can pay a fine for each day of his one-year prison sentence instead of serving time in jail. The European peacekeeping force in Bosnia, EUFOR, had stepped up the number of its troops in response to the tensions earlier this year. In March, NATO's Secretary General Mark Rutte pledged the military alliance's \"unwavering\" support for Bosnia's territorial integrity. \"Three decades after the Dayton Peace Agreement, I can tell you: NATO remains firmly committed to the stability of this region and to the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\" Rutte said at the time. \"We will not allow hard-won peace to be jeopardised.\"",

Then, the MIL pulls out a Tupperware with cake from under her table. Like...a full, homemade sheet cake. She slaps it on the gift table and says, 'This is carrot. From scratch. With real cream cheese frosting. You're welcome,' and just walks off. People start eating it. One groomsman says it's actually better than the real cake. The bride walks out. The groom follows.

The groom was expecting a very small backyard wedding at a friend's house, and then the 'small gathering' was at the bride's house. The wedding itself was maybe 20 people. But the bride felt like surprising the groom with over 100 people at the reception. You could see the look on his face when he walked in. He was pretty upset. So he proceeded to take edibles and get drunk. That isn't the best part!\" \"The party was awkwardly scattered throughout the choppy layout of the house. The speeches were done in the backyard on a small karaoke-like speaker. One of the bride's newly single friends, who was drunk and high, grabbed the mic and proceeded to ramble on about marriage, divorce, and how hard the dating scene is. But the best part was when she started talking about the bride's dead mom and the groom's dead dad, and she was sorry they couldn't be there, etc, etc. My favorite line from the speech was, 'I'm sorry your parents are dead.' I think at one point, I started clapping loudly to get everyone else to start clapping so someone would grab the mic. The last thing I remember was the groom puking in the front yard when I left. These people were all in their early 50s. The bride and groom have since divorced.\" —Anonymous 4. \"Originally, my daughter-in-law was the only person allowed to give a speech and a toast, but the night before my wedding, my mother-in-law texted me asking if she could please give a speech and how much it would mean to her. I hated the idea, but I said yes to keep the peace. During her 30-minute speech (I wish I were exaggerating), she talked about how hard it was to give away her son (but said she'd do it anyway), how perfect her son was for me, and shared some of his baby stories. She said how lucky I was to have him, but didn't say ONE THING ABOUT ME.\" — Distinct-Dependent24 5. \"The wedding ceremony alone took four hours, as it was done in English first, and then done all over again in Chinese. Over 600 people were stuffed into a church with no air conditioning in the middle of August. The reception was in the parking garage beneath the church. No music, no alcohol, you got one plate of takeout, one cup of lemonade, and a slice of cake that was maybe three inches. There were filled trash bags to mark where to sit, as the garage was used during the reception.\" —Anonymous 6. \"There were so many things that went south. I'll try to paint a picture for you. Vows: When the bride spoke, everyone shed a tear. It was a beautiful speech about how they met and how they had to endure a long-distance relationship for a couple of years. His? He said she spends too much money on makeup, he hates all the movies she makes him watch, and he felt pressured to propose because they had been dating for so many years. He ended with, 'Despite all that, I love you.' Entrance of the newlyweds: The groom (who is Italian) thought it would be funny to enter the room to a football chant. Instead of holding his wife's hand, he jumped around and sang as if he were in a stadium. He looked hyped — but for all the wrong reasons. Of course, he got super drunk on tequila and spent the entire night dancing with his friends.\" \"The father of the bride got drunk too and ended up in a fistfight with his own son. The bride and her mother had to break it up. It's truly a pity. They spent so much money on the wedding and planned it for so long. She looked so beautiful, and yet what people will remember is her husband acting like an asshole and her family being a mess.\" — Acrobatic_Ad_2330 7. \"My relationship with my mother was never on good terms. But naively, I assumed that for once in my life, she would understand where I was coming from when making requests for my wedding. I wanted it small and for the people I disliked from past experiences not to be sent invitations. These were only a few; the drunk family friend who had been a creep to me in the past, my ex-boyfriend and his family, and this noisy wedding coordinator who makes everything about herself. I confirmed with my mother in advance that these people wouldn't be sent an invitation. On the wedding day, I discovered that everyone I told her not to invite was there. I was completely devastated and could not believe I would be disrespected like that on my own wedding day.\" \"My groom had kicked out the drunk guy (who had also brought along his dog), but the wedding coordinator was getting in the way of the entire wedding and was given 'special permission' to stay. I did not make eye contact with any of my ex's family (who never approached me anyway), and I couldn't wait for it all to be over. My mother defended herself afterwards by saying she had the 'right' to invite whomever she wanted, regardless of my personal requests. At least now I know that she is incapable of being trustworthy.\" — TimelyAd4399 8. \"We were invited to the wedding of an employee. It was her second. The ceremony and reception were held in a relative's backyard. It was in the mid-90s and very humid. There was no shade, the ground was uneven, the grass was uncut, and there was not enough seating. The bride went the whole nine yards wearing a white gown with a train and a long veil. Her groom wore a kilt, although he wasn't from the Highlands. We brought our own drinks and chairs. The guests wore everything from shorts and cut-offs to fancy dresses. We had one port-a-potty and a pig roast that started way too late. We sweltered and starved. Finally, my husband went and sat in the car with the AC on. I grabbed our school-aged grandkids, and we took them to KFC and fed them.\" —Anonymous 9. \"My own wedding was the worst I've ever been to. My videographer canceled 30 minutes after he was supposed to be there. My MIL (RIP) wore a bright white head-to-toe outfit and scowled in *every* photo. My officiant forgot to tell people they could be seated, so we had to stop the ceremony to announce they could sit. My wedding planner had no rehearsal, so nobody took my bouquet, and I had to hold it the entire ceremony. We got married on the beach, and the wedding planner had the chairs facing the sun so nobody could actually watch the ceremony without blinding themselves. The violinist screeched out a song so badly that we couldn't even tell what it was (it was supposed to be 'At Last'). We held the reception in the backyard of our home, and none of my friends showed up for over an hour because they stopped by the bar to drink in between (we had it fully catered and an open bar).\" \"My party planner harassed me about making the final payment to all the vendors right then and there (all of my contracts stated to be paid in full within 15 days of service) so I had to go through hundreds of emails looking for the invoicing to get the link to pay, which took me almost an hour of my own reception. After being unable to track down the caterers' invoice, I asked them if they could resend it so I could make the payment. The guy almost cried when I told him I'd been trying to pay it and find the invoice because HE HADN'T EVEN SENT IT YET!!! I could've killed my party planner (yes, she was hired separately from my wedding planner). My friends were 'exhausted' and left in a group together after being at the reception for about 45 minutes to 'go back to their hotels and sleep.' I was pissed because we paid about $150/head for dinner, not even including the open bar, but I was understanding. The next morning, I woke up to photos of them being out at the bars until 2:00 a.m. They also skipped the catered brunch I was having just for them, so we could all celebrate and spend some time together. Worst. Wedding. Ever.\" — smellychef995 10. \"The bride and one of the groomsmen disappeared for about an hour. About nine months later, the bride gave birth to the groomsman's baby.\" —Anonymous 11. \"I attended a disaster of a wedding this evening. From start to not-even-finish because I left early, it was a mess. I knew nothing coming into this wedding aside from the time and place. That was the only information given on the invitation, and there was no wedding website to get more information. It turns out that it was an outdoor wedding on a humid, 95°, sunny afternoon (I thought it was indoors because I had looked up the venue). People wore shorts, tees, and slip-ons, while others wore floor-length gowns. One lady was in a full white dress. The ceremony started, or at least I thought. I couldn't hear much over the eight children there who screamed through the entire thing. Parents, of course, didn't intervene. The ceremony went fairly smoothly, although the personal vows were oddly disturbing.\" \"Cocktail hour started, and there were no directions on what to do, so I followed the herd to the bar line. At this point, I was drowning in my own sweat, and all I wanted was water. I wasn't paying attention to the people before me because I was busy fighting off flies. When it was my turn in line, I asked for water. The bartender said, 'You got it. $2.00.' I looked up and I saw the sign. No free beverages — period. Not even water. I took a second to internalize and pulled out my card. The man said, 'Oh, I'm so sorry. We operate with cash only.' Thank GOD I had some cash in my purse from a Facebook Marketplace sale. I sat and waited for dinner. I had little interest in socializing because I felt sick from the heat. Eventually, dinner started. The tables were dismissed as usual, and I got to the buffet line. It looked like such homey food, yum! Then I realized it was, in fact, homemade. No problem, who doesn't love a home-cooked meal? Me when there are FLIES ALL OVER THE FOOD. Seriously, all up in the food. I took the smallest amount possible to be polite. I was so hungry and desperate that I did take a few bites. Within hours, I was creating jobs for local plumbers. I barely knew the bride and groom. I knew the bride about four years ago, but we were more acquaintances, and I went to the same school as the groom. Not sure why I made the list, but there were a lot of people there. Next was dessert! Can't mess up dessert, right? Wrong. So wrong. Flies were on the dessert, as expected by now. But how was I supposed to eat the dessert? There were no plates, napkins, forks, or anything. The buffet equipment has been cleared. So I watched as people walked around holding dessert in their hands. During all of this, there was also drunken family drama and kids still screaming and making ginormous messes. Next were the speeches. At this point, I just started taking notes for this post. There were six speeches in total, and one of them was actually good! Sweet, heartfelt, funny. I forgot where I was for a second. The rest...roasts, an angry bride, and a brother started a fight with the groom. And I mean a literal fight. I couldn't hear what it was about above the screaming kids and the groom's lack of front teeth. All I gathered was that it had something to do with the bride. The fight got taken to the lawn, and when people gathered to assist, I slipped out and came home. I genuinely don't feel like this was real life. Like this had to be a practical joke, right?? I may politely decline invitations that I have no information about moving forward.\" — According-Citron-825 12. \"Went to a wedding in Tennessee for my wife's coworker. The preacher, who was told to stick to the script, went off about how the wife was to submit to her husband. The caterer was named something like Kathy's Kountry Kitchen (yep). Also, the groom's family forgot to get a liquor license for the reception, so they 'donated' to the Sheriff's Benevolent Fund. The food was good, though.\" —Anonymous 13. \"The wedding was lovely in the backyard of a designer home. Everything was perfect: the ceremony, the dinner, everything. Later on, two punk teenage boys came into the backyard and grabbed some liquor and jumped the fence. The bride's older brother chased them until he fell into a deep hole in the field behind the house. Alas, the thieves got away. The next day, the bride's brother and nephew checked the field in the daylight in case the thieves dropped their loot. That deep hole? It was ankle deep. The bride's brother might have had a little too much to drink on the evening of the wedding.\" — charmingelf8181 14. \"I attended the wedding of two friends of mine. They'd been together for several years at that point, had one child together, and had been through a lot of drama — many peaks and valleys in their relationship — mostly due to the bride and her colorful life. But in the end, they decided to get married. Because of all this, a lot of our mutual friends and fellow invitees elected not to attend their wedding. But some of us foolishly decided to show our support and attended anyway. What transpired: There wasn't enough seating for all the guests, which meant many of us had to stand. The ceremony was over an hour late because they were livestreaming the service to loved ones who couldn't be there and had technical difficulties. That meant that we, the seatless guests, had to stand even longer in our formal wear shoes. It was so painful!\" \"When the ceremony was going to finally start, the bride decided she needed a smoke first. So she walked past all the guests in her wedding dress with her cigarette and lighter in hand to go smoke outside. That was our first glimpse of her. The groom's father performed the ceremony. He and the groom's mother really disliked the bride due to her colorful past, but they tried their best to accept what they couldn't change. However, the groom's father couldn't completely hide his dislike and broke down in tears twice while performing the ceremony. They weren't tears of joy. At the reception, the couple decided to do the garter toss. The groom retrieved the garter from his bride's thigh and threw it into the crowd of male guests to catch. The bride's 13 or 14-year-old son from one of her previous marriages enthusiastically jumped to the front so that he would be the one to catch it. I should have heeded our mutual friends' warnings and skipped this wedding.\" — RobynNeonGal 15. \"The former boyfriend showed up at the reception crying. He brought a date.\" —Anonymous 16. \"I went to a wedding just to never get fed. It was around October, and it was pretty chilly. We were in a barn by the way. The bride and groom wanted some extra pictures, like EXTRA. They insisted that they take pictures with every single relative. So we waited, and waited, and waited for three hours straight before we decided to leave and go to a restaurant down the road.\" —Anonymous 17. \"The worst wedding I ever attended was an objectively lovely wedding, but one I think (in hindsight) I probably shouldn't have gone to. For background, this was a couple of my husband's friends from college who got married a few months after we did (this was 15 years ago now). We'd invited them to our wedding, and they never RSVPed one way or another. Our best man called them to find out if they were coming so we could get our final headcount, and they said yes, they were. They then proceeded to no-show (they were living out of state at the time, so they knew they weren't coming, they just didn't bother to tell us). So we were out the money for their meals, but whatever.\" \"Fast forward several months, and they are back in our home state and planning their wedding. We never received an invite, so I assumed we were not invited. Then the bride messages me to ask if we are coming. I told her we did not receive an invitation, but if we were invited, then we would be honored to attend. She kept telling me to let her know if we were coming since they needed a final headcount, and I kept telling her that we would be there. Nothing ambiguous at all about my response. We get to their wedding, only to find that it is a formal reception with assigned seating, and we are not on the list. The caterers found some extra chairs to squeeze us in at a table with our other mutual friends, but it was super awkward. At one point, the bride said to us, 'Oh, we didn't think you were coming,' to which I replied, 'I told you repeatedly that we were, though?' So I can only assume that they assumed we were going to no-show in retaliation for them having no-showed on us or something, which, sorry, but we're not that petty. We took their invite in good faith, so it would have been nice if our RSVP had also been taken in good faith. Oh well! Oh, and there was a gigantic rubber band in the mousse cup I had from their dessert bar, which I found out when I took a huge bite and felt it in my mouth. That was gross.\" —Anonymous 18. And: \"Mine. I left it to my groom to get the music and photographer. I handled the venue, lots of amazing food, and an open bar. He had a friend do the pictures, and he had no idea what he was doing. The music was all slow, boring, semi-love songs. Nothing to dance and party to. We actually lasted 24 years, but the last five, we were just waiting for our last child to graduate from high school to get divorced. So boring...both the wedding and the marriage.\" —Anonymous",

Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day. Today's top stories U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff has arrived in Moscow and is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin today. His visit comes as President Trump's deadline for the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine or face economic penalties was moved up to the end of this week. 🎧 Trump is threatening secondary sanctions and tariffs on Russian energy exports , which would penalize countries like China that purchase their oil and gas, NPR's Charles Maynes tells Up First . Trump's policies and rhetoric toward Russia shifted when a ceasefire with Ukraine did not happen after multiple meetings between the U.S. and Moscow. Putin has expressed that his army has momentum on the battlefield and shown no indication that he plans to back down. With Witkoff's latest meeting, Maynes says both sides may be looking for a compromise — not the full immediate peace Trump demands, but a solution that would keep him from fulfilling his threats on Friday. Prominent supporters of the president have recently intensified their criticism of Israel because of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Republican Party has long been aligned with Israel in its war against Gaza, but now the rift within the party is creating a political challenge for Trump. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia last week called Israel's actions a genocide. Former White House aide Steve Bannon warned of the long-term expense of this conflict and Trump's risk of losing young Republicans' support. 🎧 Republican strategist Alex Conant says we are now in the beginning stages of the lame duck period of Trump's presidency. Conant tells NPR's Franco Ordoñez that there is a fight brewing to determine what the Republican Party will look like post-Trump, with a strong push for an America First party. Republican strategist Sean Walsh says the president needs to focus on the midterm elections and appealing to the majority of his party, who support Israel, if he hopes to keep control of the House. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly initiated a grand jury investigation into how the Obama administration handled the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. NPR has not independently verified this information, which was first reported by Fox News and other outlets. Bondi launching the inquiry suggests a trend that blurs the line between the Justice Department, which has been mostly independent, and the White House. 🎧 The president has responded to the reports of Bondi's actions by deflecting responsibility while praising her performance , NPR's Domenico Montanaro says. Trump has had tensions with attorneys general in the past and has shown a willingness to fire them when disagreements arise. Bondi has taken a different approach with the president . She has expressed outrage on Trump's behalf before Congress when his ethics were questioned and has shielded him regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files. Many view her actions toward the Obama administration about Russia as a distraction from the Epstein conflict. Today marks the 60th anniversary of the landmark Voting Rights Act , which was signed into law by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson to protect against racial discrimination. However, the lawful efforts to fight against the dilution of Black voters' collective power at the ballot box may be ending soon, as a new legal argument progresses toward the U.S. Supreme Court.

      "ai_content": "U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has landed in Moscow for critical negotiations aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This development follows closely behind President Trump's escalated timeline, demanding that Russia halt military operations by week's end under threat of severe economic repercussions. Trump's administration had previously signaled potential secondary sanctions and tariffs targeting Russian energy exports, impacting nations such as China that rely heavily on these imports.\nIn parallel, the United States commemorates the 60th anniversary of the landmark Voting Rights Act—a pivotal piece of legislation designed to protect minority voters—while grappling with emerging threats to voter access and participation. These developments underscore the complex interplay of domestic policy concerns alongside international diplomatic efforts.\nThe geopolitical landscape further complicates matters as Trump's approach towards Russia undergoes significant shifts since failed attempts at securing a ceasefire with Ukraine led to increased tensions rather than resolution. As Witkoff engages with Putin, analysts suggest that both parties might seek a middle ground, aiming for a partial de-escalation rather than an outright cessation of hostilities, thus averting Trump's looming punitive measures.\nDomestically, the Republican Party confronts ideological fractures heightened by divergent views on foreign policy stances, particularly regarding Israel and its involvement in the Gaza conflict. Notable figures within the GOP, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and former White House aide Steve Bannon, have voiced stark critiques ranging from accusations of genocide to warnings about the financial toll and waning youth support for continued engagement.\nAs the nation approaches crucial midterm elections, strategists emphasize the importance of rallying core Republican constituents around shared values while navigating intra-party disputes. Amidst these multifaceted issues, Attorney General Pam Bondi reports on related legal proceedings, adding another layer to the intricate tapestry of current events.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON – Wednesday is the 60th anniversary of the day President Lyndon Johnson made his way to the U.S. Capitol and, with Martin Luther King Jr. standing behind him, signed the Voting Rights Act into law. The act protected the right to vote and ensured the government would fight efforts to suppress it, especially those aimed at Black voters. For many Americans, it was the day U.S. democracy fully began . Recommended Videos That was then. The law has been slowly eroding for more than a decade, starting with the 2013 Supreme Court decision ending the requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. Within hours of the ruling , some states that had been under the preclearance provision began announcing plans for stricter voting laws. Those changes have continued, especially since the 2020 presidential election and President Donald Trump's false claims that widespread fraud cost him reelection. The Supreme Court upheld a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, but in its upcoming term it's scheduled to hear a case that could roll back that decision and another that would effectively neuter the law. Voting rights experts say those cases will largely determine whether a landmark law passed during a turbulent era decades ago will have future anniversaries to mark. “We’re at a critical juncture right now,\" said Demetria McCain, director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \"And, let’s be clear, our democracy is only about to turn 60 when the Voting Rights Act anniversary gets here. I say that because there are so many attacks on voting rights, particularly as it relates to Black communities and communities of color.\" Native Americans celebrate a win that could be temporary The reservation of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Canadian border, a region of forests, small lakes and vast prairie land. Its main highway is a mix of small houses, mobile homes and businesses. A gleaming casino and hotel stand out, not far from grazing bison. In 2024, the tribe and another in North Dakota, the Spirit Lake Tribe, formed a joint political district for the first time. They had filed a lawsuit arguing that the way lines were drawn for state legislative seats denied them the right to elect candidates of their choice. U.S. District Court Chief Judge Peter Welte agreed and put a new map in place . State Rep. Collette Brown ran for the legislature because she wanted to see more Native American representation, and she won under the new map. “It felt surreal. I felt accomplished, I felt recognized,\" said Brown, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and the Spirit Lake Tribe’s Gaming Commission executive director. “I felt, OK, it’s time for us to really start making change and really start educating from within so that we’re not silenced.” Brown, a Democrat, co-sponsored several bills on Native American issues that became law, including aid for repatriation of remains and artifacts and alerts for missing Indigenous people. This year's anniversary of the Voting Rights Act “forces you to look at how far we’ve come,” from Native Americans to women, said Jamie Azure, chairman of the Turtle Mountain tribe. Now the future of their district is in the hands of the Supreme Court. Will individuals be allowed to file voting rights challenges? The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals , which covers North Dakota and six other states, overturned Welte's decision 2-1 , saying the tribes and entities such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the ACLU do not have a right to sue over potential violations of voters' constitutional rights. That ruling expanded on an earlier 8th Circuit opinion out of Arkansas that rejected a different challenge on the same grounds. Late last month, a 3rd Circuit court panel ruled in a separate case out of Arkansas that only the U.S. attorney general can file such cases — not private individuals or groups. Those decisions upended decades of precedent. The Supreme Court has stayed the ruling for the tribes while it decides whether it will take the North Dakota case. The University of Michigan Law School Voting Rights Initiative found that since 1982 nearly 87% of claims under that part of the Voting Rights Act, known as Section 2, were from private individuals and organizations. Leaving individuals without the ability to file challenges is especially troublesome now because the Justice Department under Trump, a Republican, seems focused on other priorities, said Sophia Lin Lakin, who heads the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. The government’s voting rights unit has been dismantled and given new priorities that, she said, have turned enforcement “against the very people it was created to protect .\" The Justice Department declined to answer questions about its voting rights priorities, cases it is pursuing or whether it would be involved in the voting rights cases coming before the nation's highest court. Supreme Court weighs another case on race and congressional districts Two years ago, voting rights activists celebrated when the Supreme Court preserved Section 2 in a case out of Alabama that required the state to draw an addition congressional district to benefit Black voters. Now it's poised to rehear a similar case out of Louisiana that could modify or undo that decision. The court heard the case in March but did not make a decision during the term. In an order on Friday, the court asked the lawyers to supply briefs explaining “whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution.” Robert Weiner, the director of voting rights for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said while it is a “matter of concern” that the court is asking the question, the fact the nine justices did not reach a decision during the last term suggests there weren’t five votes already. “They wouldn’t need re-argument if the sides had already been chosen,“ he said. Trump's Justice Department shifts focus on voting issues At a time when the remaining protections of the Voting Rights Act are under threat, the Justice Department has shifted its election-related priorities. Under Attorney General Pam Bondi , it has dropped or withdrawn from several election- and voting-related cases. The department instead has focused on concerns of voter fraud raised by conservative activists following years of false claims surrounding elections. The department also has sent requests for voter registration information as well as data on election fraud and warnings of election violations to at least 19 states. In addition to the shift in focus at the Justice Department, federal legislation to protect voting rights has gone nowhere. Democrats have reintroduced the John Lewis voting rights bill , but it's legislation they failed to pass in 2022 when they held both houses of Congress and the White House and needed some Republican support in the Senate. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order seeking to overhaul voting in the states, which includes a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement on the federal voting form, though much of it has been blocked in the courts. The GOP-controlled House passed a bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. And gerrymandering state legislative and congressional districts remains prevalent. The slow chipping away at the 60-year-old law has created a nation with an unequal distribution of voting rights, said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights center at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Some states have been active in expanding access to voting while others have been focused on restricting the vote . “The last five to 10 years,\" he said, “the experiences of voters increasingly depend on where they live.” ___ Dura reported from Belcourt, N.D.

      "ai_summary": "On the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act's signing, concerns arise as its protections face potential rollback after nearly two decades of erosion following a pivotal Supreme Court decision. The original legislation safeguarded against voter suppression, notably affecting African American citizens. Recent legal challenges threaten further weakening of these safeguards, raising alarms among civil rights advocates who fear diminished democratic participation, particularly within minority communities.",
      "ai_content": "As America commemorates the 60th anniversary of one of its most significant legislative achievements—the Voting Rights Act—concerns mount regarding the durability of its protective measures. Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson alongside civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., the Act represented a monumental step towards ensuring equal access to the ballot box, specifically targeting discriminatory practices that historically disenfranchised Black voters and other minorities.\nHowever, the landscape of voting rights protection has shifted dramatically since the Act's inception. The turning point came in 2013 when the Supreme Court invalidated Section 4(b), which contained the formula determining which jurisdictions required federal clearance prior to altering their voting procedures—a measure known as 'preclearance.' This decision unleashed a wave of state-level initiatives aiming to impose new restrictions on voting processes, often justified by unfounded allegations of electoral fraud.\nIn the wake of the 2020 presidential election, where former President Donald Trump propagated baseless claims of widespread cheating, several states swiftly moved forward with implementing stringent voting regulations. These actions were met with resistance from various quarters, including lawsuits challenging such laws' constitutionality.\nDespite facing setbacks, proponents of voting rights secured a partial victory in 2023 when the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle underlying Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting. Yet, looming before them are two high-stakes cases set to potentially unravel this progress. One seeks to dismantle the remaining vestiges of preclearance requirements; the other aims to dilute the enforcement mechanisms central to upholding fair elections across diverse districts.\nDemetria McCain, director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, encapsulates the urgency felt nationwide: 'We're at a critical juncture right now,' she asserts. 'Our democracy is only about to turn 60 when we reach this milestone... There are so many attacks on voting rights, particularly as it relates to Black communities and communities of color.'\nParallel to these developments, indigenous tribes like the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe achieved a historic collaboration through forming a joint political district—a move born from litigation asserting that existing boundaries diluted their collective influence. This development underscores ongoing struggles for representation and equity within America's complex tapestry of governance.",

      "content": "CBS Mornings hosts reacted with sadness and surprise to the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that was announced Thursday. A longtime network morning show veteran believes Gayle King \"has lost a lot of her leverage\" as \"CBS Mornings\" is mired in third place with an ownership change looming. The FCC approved a long-planned, $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media last month which will soon place CBS News under new ownership . The deal, which is set to close Thursday, will see Skydance CEO David Ellison take control of the Tiffany Network and its struggling news division. Industry insiders believe Ellison, who was spotted sitting with President Donald Trump at a UFC event in April, will aim to eliminate the perceived liberal slant at CBS News. Ellison’s team has already committed to appointing an ombudsman to oversee CBS News content, and staffers are bracing for other changes as Skydance honchos put their stamp on the network. CBS STAFFERS SPECULATE ON GAYLE KING'S FUTURE AS NETWORK BOSSES PUSH 'EDITORIAL SHIFT' ON STRUGGLING AM SHOW \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King reports for CBS Mornings live from the United Center in Chicago for the 2024 Democratic National Convention. (Michele Crowe/CBS News via Getty Images) This has put a spotlight on King’s \"CBS Mornings,\" which has never seriously challenged NBC’s \"Today\" or ABC’s \"Good Morning America\" for any substantial length of time, instead settling for a perennial third-place finish among all relevant viewership measurables. \"CBS Mornings,\" co-anchored by King, Tony Dokoupil and Nate Burleson, averaged 1.8 million total viewers during July, compared to 2.7 million for \"GMA\" and 2.4 million for \"Today.\" While third place is nothing new for CBS’ morning show, the program is also steadily losing viewers. \"CBS Mornings\" averaged 1.9 million viewers in 2025 through July 27, shedding 10% of the 2.2 million it averaged during the same time period in 2024. The ratings drop is even worse among the advertiser-coveted demographic of adults aged 25-54, as \"CBS Mornings\" has averaged 332,000 demo viewers in 2025—a loss of a quarter of the 441,000 it managed in 2024. NBC’s \"Today\" and ABC’s \"Good Morning America\" have also lost viewers compared to the first seven months of 2024, but the declines are not as severe as the drop-off at CBS. CBS HOST GAYLE KING INSISTS DEI MEANS ‘DEFINITELY EARNED IT’ Gayle King kisses the ground after exiting the Blue Origin hatch. (Courtesy: Blue Origin) \"CBS Mornings\" has also lost 6% of total viewers and 18% in the demo when comparing its average audience since Election Day 2024 to the period before President Trump’s victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris. King, who has long been the subject of often-unflattering tabloid fodder, has not helped \"CBS Mornings\" increase its audience despite the free publicity she generates by hobnobbing with A-listers. King is regularly on red carpets and often posts photos at lavish events. The high-paid anchor was photographed alongside Oprah Winfrey and Kris Jenner lounging on a yacht off the coast of Spain in July after attending Jeff Bezos’ $50 million wedding. In April, King drew criticism when she was part of an all-female crew for a 10-minute Blue Origin space flight. Some complained about the environmental impact, and others questioned if the brief flight was a worthwhile use of resources. The Blue Origin space flight gave \"CBS Mornings\" a brief bump, but the program has since lost 5% of its 2025 total viewers and 17% of demo viewers since the day King went to space. The ownership change has led to industry chatter that changes are inevitable, with much speculation around King and whether incoming executives will keep her around when her contract expires—reportedly in May 2026. \"Gayle is the only CBS News employee making eight figures, and she’s gotten anything she wants for years, including choosing her executive producer [Shawna Thomas] and doing alienating coverage out of touch with the CBS viewer,\" a longtime network morning show producer told Fox News Digital. \"Now that the numbers are slipping badly, Gayle has lost a lot of her leverage,\" they continued. \"Combine that with her embarrassing space flight and her tasteless swanning around on David Geffen’s yacht last month with Kris Jenner, and she’s due for a big pay cut and a comeuppance.\" King has also been a champion of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), which is something Ellison’s team has promised to dismantle at CBS. She also sparked backlash for taking a 2017 vacation with the Obamas while she worked on a show that covered politics. At the time, King insisted her trip to Tahiti alongside the former president was not political, but her cozy relationship with the former First Family helped tarnish the reputation of CBS News—something incoming management is believed to want to distance itself from. GAYLE KING DISAPPOINTED BY BACKLASH TO BLUE ORIGIN FLIGHT, ACCUSES CRITICS OF SEXISM CBS Mornings Co-Hosts Gayle King, Tony Dokoupil, and Nate Burleson with CBS Mornings and CBS News Streaming Network Anchor and Correspondent Vladimir Duthiers, and CBS Mornings Executive Producer Shawna Thomas. ( Michele Crowe/CBS News) A CBS News staffer recently told Fox News Digital that King is \"insulated by her team,\" which includes Thomas. However, an \"editorial shift\" is being pushed by CBS News president and executive editor Tom Cibrowski and his No. 2, Wendy Fisher, the network's senior vice president of editorial. \"They’re changing story selection and tweaking the show some,\" the CBS staffer said. \"I know Tom has been involved in the show heavily though,\" they continued. \"He wants us to focus on stories outside of major cities and in the middle of the country. Stories that affect real people and that they’re talking about at home.\" The staffer believes the changes Cibrowski has implemented over the past couple of months are him \"putting his mark on the division\" and have nothing to do with the parent company Paramount's settlement with Trump or the Paramount-Skydance merger. In September, \"CBS Mornings\" will ditch its studio in Times Square and return to CBS Broadcast Center on 57th Street in New York City. It remains to be seen what other changes are on the horizon once Skydance executives begin to put their mark on the division. CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Federal Communications Commission recently greenlit a monumental $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, signaling a seismic shift in media ownership that will soon bring David Ellison into leadership roles across various networks, including CBS News.\nThe integration of Skydance Media into CBS News is expected to usher in strategic changes aimed at addressing what some perceive as a leftward bias in current reporting.

Data reveals a stark contrast in viewership trends; while 'CBS Mornings' saw a slight increase in overall audiences from one year to the next, it experienced a notable dip when focusing solely on the aforementioned demographic segment.\nAs 'CBS Mornings' continues to navigate through these challenging times, questions linger about Gayle King's standing within the network amidst broader organizational shifts.

And, without a shred of evidence in any form? Where is their outrage when President Donald Trump is allowing his administration to move Ghislaine Maxwell, an actual convicted pedophile on multiple accounts, with tons of actual evidence to prove her guilt, from one low-security facility to an even lower-security location? And the president “wishes her well?” Aren’t they at least curious as to why his administration is involved at all?And while I’m thinking about it, why aren’t Republican officials outraged and trying to stop the move? Or are they too busy figuring out how to gerrymander their district before the next election?Come on, people. Get registered and vote so we can work to restore a decent democracy in our government.Jim Cronin, Commerce CitySpeedy bikers should show some courtesyI’ve been riding the Denver bike paths for many years. And bikers “in the good old days” were respectful of fellow bikers. Everyone hollered “on your left” as they passed slower bikers. Or, just as good, they rang their bells. So we riders being passed knew they were coming and maintained our path.That has changed. Most bikers on the Cherry Creek Trail and the South Platte River Trail say nothing. They go flying by. Today, three bikers on each other’s tail did that. A couple of weeks ago, I was going one way on the path, and another lady was going the other way. As we were passing each other, a biker rode right between us.And, of course, the scooter riders have no idea how to be safe. They, too, come up behind and zip by.What is so darn difficult about saying “on your left?” Why did that stop? Unfortunately, I have to say I’m getting scared of riding the bike paths. Come on, fellow bikers, let us slower riders know when we’re going to be passed.Sherry Richardson, DenverFederal relief funding for adult education arrives, but the fight isn’t overThe recent release of long-delayed federal funds for adult education programs in Colorado and across the nation is a welcome relief, but it’s not enough. This temporary fix does nothing to resolve the chronic underfunding and instability that plagues these programs year after year.Adult education serves millions of Americans annually — low-income individuals, legal immigrants working to improve their English, formerly incarcerated people rebuilding their lives, and single parents seeking a better future for their families. These learners work hard to break the cycle of poverty and dependency.While the U.S. spends around $10,000 per elementary school student, these adult learners receive just $583 a year, according to the Coalition on Adult Basic Education. Just 100 hours of instruction can boost annual income by nearly $10,000. Nearly half of GED recipients pursue higher education.This success is powered by underpaid educators, many of whom take multiple jobs, manage several centers, and work without benefits. Their commitment keeps the system running against the odds. Adult education isn’t charity, it’s a smart, high-return investment.Related ArticlesRequest to unseal Epstein grand jury transcripts likely to disappoint, ex-prosecutors sayLawmakers from both parties helped secure this year’s delayed funding, but next year’s budget already threatens cuts.

He also laments the decline in courteous behavior among cyclists sharing Denver's bike paths.",
      "ai_content": "In a recent letter published under the title 'Ghislaine Maxwell prison upgrade: Silence from those who bought into “Pizzagate”', Jim Cronin expresses frustration towards individuals who once fervently believed in baseless claims linking Democrats to a child trafficking conspiracy known as 'Pizzagate'. Now, these same individuals remain silent as Ghislaine Maxwell, a woman convicted of numerous sexual offenses against children, is moved from a medium-security facility to a minimum-security institution within Texas. The author questions where the indignation lies now, especially given the substantial evidence confirming Maxwell's crimes—a stark contrast to the previous era of unfounded accusations.\nCronin further challenges Republican politicians, asking if they share his dismay and whether they're willing to take action against what he perceives as an injustice facilitated by Trump's administration. His call to arms extends beyond political leaders; he urges citizens to register and vote, emphasizing the need for democratic restoration.\nSeparately, Sherry Richardson shares her concerns about safety issues on Denver's bike trails. She reminisces about times when cyclists showed respect through simple gestures like signaling intentions via voice or bell. However, she notes a disturbing shift toward impoliteness and recklessness, particularly among faster-moving bikes and scooters that disregard established cycling etiquette. This change has made her apprehensive about using shared pathways, highlighting a broader issue of declining civility in public spaces.",

      "content": "F acing images of violent white mobs defending racial segregation, the condemnation of the world and of its own citizens, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, a law meant to end the hypocrisy of a democratic country that denied Black people the power of their vote. Sixty years later, race remains at the center of American politics. Cases before the US supreme court, and a platoon of Texas legislators fleeing the state to prevent redistricting, demonstrate how the Voting Rights Act – and its erosion – remains on the frontline of the political battlefield. “Democracy is at stake,” said Todd Cox, associate director-counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Even as voting rights advocates use the act to win additional congressional representation in Alabama and press cases in Louisiana and North Carolina, a conservative supreme court makes gains precarious, he said. “We wouldn’t be under such a threat if we weren’t doing so well in making sure our communities were engaged, that they were turning out and that their rights were protected,” Cox said. “This is a cyclical part of history, that when we see some success in advancing rights, there’s always backlash.” Veterans of the struggle for civil rights view passage of the act as a revolutionary, historical demarcation point equal to the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Confederate general Robert E Lee’s surrender at Appomattox or the establishment of women’s suffrage. Enforcement of the Voting Rights Act fundamentally rewrote politics in America. “I know I stand on the shoulders of folks ... who fought and died in some cases,” Cox said. Though constitutional amendments passed after the American civil war ended slavery and commanded racial equality before the law, American lawmakers regularly found ways to keep Black citizens from exercising political power. Literacy tests, poll taxes, separate ballot boxes for Black and white voters, white-only primary elections, purges of Black voters from the rolls and discriminatory district lines rigged elections for white voters in the US’s Jim Crow era. Each time a court struck down a state law or demanded the end of a discriminatory practice, obstructionist local lawmakers – mostly but not exclusively in southern states – would quickly adapt, often enacting new election changes without enough time for a court to intervene. Civil rights laws at the time held insufficient authority to stop the practice. After years of campaigns for voting rights and racial equality across the south, the civil rights struggle came to a head in March 1965 in Selma, Alabama. The death of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a Baptist deacon and local voting rights activist, at the hands of state troopers led 600 people to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. State troopers attacked demonstrators with truncheons and teargas. As networks broadcast the assault, the US watched future US representative John Lewis get beaten into unconsciousness by white police officers live on national television. Support crystalized for civil and voting rights after the events of the “Bloody Sunday” broadcast. Congress wrote the Voting Rights Act to prevent the case-by-case whack-a-mole games local lawmakers were playing with election rules. It forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to clear elections changes with the Department of Justice before they could go into effect. It banned literacy tests to vote and allowed challenges to district maps when those maps would not allow proportional representation for minority voters. The principles of the Voting Rights Act have shaped the way lawmakers from the halls of Congress to a city council hearing room have to respond politically to voters of color. Congress has reauthorized the Voting Rights Act four times since its enactment, each time under a Republican president. But the law’s protections have suffered a death of a thousand cuts. In the Shelby County v Holder case of 2013, the US supreme court held that the data defining jurisdictions with a history of discrimination was too old to be relied upon; Congress must update it for the Voting Rights Act’s pre-clearance rules in Section 5 to remain constitutional, the court ruled. Republicans in Congress have blocked legislation – the John Lewis voting rights advancement act – updating the law, effectively ending pre-clearance. “It was a pretty significant blow to the project of ensuring voting free of racial discrimination in this country,” said Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU’s voting rights project. “I think it really accelerated in this moment the attacks on voting access across the country.” States previously restricted by pre-clearance enacted a wave of election legislation following the ruling, closing polling places, changing voter registration rules and redrawing district lines unhindered. The 5-4 decision in Rucho v Common Cause in 2019 further eroded the power of the Voting Rights Act, by explicitly permitting political gerrymandering, even as racial gerrymandering remained off-limits. The mid-decade redistricting in Texas proposed by Donald Trump presents a particularly vivid example of the consequences of an end to pre-clearance and recent supreme court decisions. Democratic state representatives have fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum to pass the redistricting legislation, which would likely grant Republicans an additional five congressional seats in Texas by concentrating some minority voters into fewer districts while diluting clusters of other voters. “Those maps would have had to be reviewed by the federal government coming in after the fact to challenge them, and winning,” Lakin said. In 2003, the eighth circuit federal appellate court further restricted the use of the Voting Rights Act, ruling in Arkansas State Conference NAACP v Arkansas Board of Apportionment that private groups do not have a right to challenge state election laws under the act; only the Department of Justice can bring a voting rights case to court. A second eighth circuit decision extended the ban on private voting rights suits from redistricting cases to suits challenging restrictions on voter assistance. Of the 180 or so successful claims brought under the Voting Rights Act, only 15 have been brought by the Department of Justice, said Jacqueline De León, senior staff attorney with the Native American Rights Fund. The Department of Justice’s voting rights division used to have about 30 staff attorneys; under the Trump administration, it has lost all but two or three , she said. “We know the Department of Justice is not going to be in the business of enforcing voting rights,” De León said. “Right now, we don’t know if there will be a future where a Voting Rights Act is available to our country. This is really a moment for concern and reflection on this anniversary.” Lakin said she expects the eighth circuit ruling to be appealed to the supreme court. Meanwhile, a case in Louisiana that has reached the US supreme court threatens the last leg standing of the Voting Rights Act. On Friday, the court signaled that it will consider the constitutionality of section 2, asking for supplemental briefs in Louisiana v Callais. The case, to be heard later this year, asks whether the state’s creation of a majority-minority congressional district violates the 14th or 15th amendment to the constitution. “I think this is, unfortunately, another opportunity for the court to continue to attack this pillar of our democracy, the Voting Rights Act,” Lakin said. In Callais, a group of “non-African-American voters” filed suit against the state of Louisiana, arguing that lawmakers acting on the order of the federal court drew a congressional district map that unconstitutionally considered race. The Equal Protection Clause of the US constitution and the 15th amendment’s guarantee that the right to vote cannot be denied because of race says that lawmakers cannot consider race predominantly over other factors when redistricting without a compelling reason. But section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires lawmakers to consider race when it is necessary to ensure that the voting power of racial minorities has fair representation. The cases are an effort to create conflict between the Voting Rights Act and the constitution as a rationale for a conservative court to chip away, Lakin said. “Congress can enact laws to ensure the 14th and 15th amendments are given life,” she said. “I think that there’s an attempt to create tensions around this and say that there’s a disconnect with the Voting Rights Act. But as the supreme court has stated ... the act is a properly, constitutionally authorized use of Congress’s powers.” Such a finding would turn hard-fought civil rights law on its head. It would establish a legal basis for white voters to challenge laws meant to protect minority voters from discrimination. “I would say it’s a perversion of what the Department of Justice has symbolized, specifically what its historic role, its purpose was meant to be,” Lakin said.",

Despite these efforts, activists continue to fight for fair elections and protection against voter suppression, highlighting the ongoing battle for democracy and civil rights.",
      "ai_content": "In what many consider one of America's most significant achievements towards ensuring electoral fairness, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law amidst scenes reminiscent of past struggles with racial discrimination. The legislation emerged as a direct response to the blatant denial of African Americans' right to vote—a fundamental aspect of true democracy—by violent white mobs and systemic racism. As we mark sixty years since its inception, it's evident that while progress has been made, the issues of race and voting remain deeply intertwined within the fabric of American society.\nToday, the United States Supreme Court's rulings have cast doubt upon the effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act, leading to concerns about potential backsliding in minority voting rights protections. In particular, recent legal battles highlight the tension between federal oversight intended to safeguard voters and states' desires for autonomy in election laws. This conflict came sharply into focus when a group of Texas lawmakers sought refuge outside the state's borders to avoid compliance with new redistricting plans deemed necessary to ensure equitable representation.\nAmidst these developments, leaders like Todd Cox of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund emphasize the critical nature of maintaining robust enforcement mechanisms for the Voting Rights Act. They argue that successes achieved through community engagement and advocacy could easily unravel without continued vigilance. The sentiment echoes across generations; veterans of the civil rights movement regard the Voting Rights Act not just as a piece of legislation, but as a historic milestone comparable to other pivotal moments in U.S. history.\nAs debates rage on Capitol Hill and courtroom benches alike, the question looms large: Will future administrations uphold the spirit of this landmark law? Or will further erosions lead us down a path where democracy itself becomes compromised? With each passing year, the stakes only grow higher, reminding us that the quest for justice and equality is far from over.",

      "description": "Decades after its passage, the revolutionary law continues to face threats and attempts to pervert its purpose",
      "content": "Facing images of violent white mobs defending racial segregation, the condemnation of the world and of its own citizens, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, a law meant to end the hypocrisy of a democratic country that denied Black people the power of their vote. Sixty years later, race remains at the center of American politics. Cases before the US supreme court, and a platoon of Texas legislators fleeing the state to prevent redistricting, demonstrate how the Voting Rights Act – and its erosion – remains on the frontline of the political battlefield. “Democracy is at stake,” said Todd Cox, associate director-counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Even as voting rights advocates use the act to win additional congressional representation in Alabama and press cases in Louisiana and North Carolina, a conservative supreme court makes gains precarious, he said. “We wouldn’t be under such a threat if we weren’t doing so well in making sure our communities were engaged, that they were turning out and that their rights were protected,” Cox said. “This is a cyclical part of history, that when we see some success in advancing rights, there’s always backlash.” Veterans of the struggle for civil rights view passage of the act as a revolutionary, historical demarcation point equal to the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Confederate general Robert E Lee’s surrender at Appomattox or the establishment of women’s suffrage. Enforcement of the Voting Rights Act fundamentally rewrote politics in America. “I know I stand on the shoulders of folks ... who fought and died in some cases,” Cox said. Though constitutional amendments passed after the American civil war ended slavery and commanded racial equality before the law, American lawmakers regularly found ways to keep Black citizens from exercising political power. Literacy tests, poll taxes, separate ballot boxes for Black and white voters, white-only primary elections, purges of Black voters from the rolls and discriminatory district lines rigged elections for white voters in the US’s Jim Crow era. Each time a court struck down a state law or demanded the end of a discriminatory practice, obstructionist local lawmakers – mostly but not exclusively in southern states – would quickly adapt, often enacting new election changes without enough time for a court to intervene. Civil rights laws at the time held insufficient authority to stop the practice. After years of campaigns for voting rights and racial equality across the south, the civil rights struggle came to a head in March 1965 in Selma, Alabama. The death of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a Baptist deacon and local voting rights activist, at the hands of state troopers led 600 people to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. State troopers attacked demonstrators with truncheons and teargas. As networks broadcast the assault, the US watched future US representative John Lewis get beaten into unconsciousness by white police officers live on national television. Support crystalized for civil and voting rights after the events of the “Bloody Sunday” broadcast. Congress wrote the Voting Rights Act to prevent the case-by-case whack-a-mole games local lawmakers were playing with election rules. It forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to clear elections changes with the Department of Justice before they could go into effect. It banned literacy tests to vote and allowed challenges to district maps when those maps would not allow proportional representation for minority voters. The principles of the Voting Rights Act have shaped the way lawmakers from the halls of Congress to a city council hearing room have to respond politically to voters of color. Congress has reauthorized the Voting Rights Act four times since its enactment, each time under a Republican president. But the law’s protections have suffered a death of a thousand cuts. In the Shelby County v Holder case of 2013, the US supreme court held that the data defining jurisdictions with a history of discrimination was too old to be relied upon; Congress must update it for the Voting Rights Act’s pre-clearance rules in Section 5 to remain constitutional, the court ruled.

      "ai_content": "As the United States marks six decades since the landmark Voting Rights Act was signed into law, the legislation stands as a testament to America's enduring battle for true democracy. Enacted amidst scenes of violence where white mobs sought to maintain racial segregation, Congress responded with a historic piece of legislation aimed at rectifying the glaring contradiction between America's democratic ideals and the reality faced by Black citizens—namely, the denial of their right to vote.\nToday, sixty years later, the specter of racism lingers at the heart of American politics. High-profile legal battles in front of the U.S. Supreme Court and strategic maneuvers by Texas legislators attempting to evade federal oversight underscore the continued relevance—and vulnerability—of the Voting Rights Act. Todd Cox, associate director-counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, emphasizes the stakes involved: 'Democracy is at stake.' While advocacy groups leverage the act to secure greater Congressional representation in states like Alabama and pursue justice in jurisdictions including Louisiana and North Carolina, victories remain fragile amid a conservative-dominated Supreme Court.\nThe Voting Rights Act represents a watershed moment comparable to other significant milestones in American history—the signing of the Declaration of Independence, General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, or the achievement of women's suffrage. Its enforcement marked a profound shift in the nation's political landscape, dismantling barriers erected throughout the Jim Crow period—from literacy tests and poll taxes to segregated polling stations and biased electoral maps designed to favor white voters.\nDespite these advances, Cox acknowledges his debt to those who laid the groundwork for today's struggles: 'I know I stand on the shoulders of folks... who fought and died in some cases.' Yet, even as constitutional amendments following the Civil War abolished slavery and mandated racial equality, legislative machinations consistently undermined Black enfranchisement until the Voting Rights Act intervened decisively.\nThe current climate suggests a familiar pattern—a cycle of progress met with reactionary pushback. As advocates celebrate recent triumphs while confronting fresh obstacles, one thing becomes abundantly clear: the fight for equitable access to the ballot box is far from over.",

      "content": "When Donald Trump fought for and won the 2024 presidential election, his victory was built partly on the false assertion that Democrats were responsible for an out-of-control crime wave in the US, with murders and rapes at record highs. Figures released by the FBI on Tuesday, however, confirm that the nation was as safe as it ever had been during the final full year of the Biden administration. Every category of crime decreased in frequency, and violent crime in particular dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s, per the report. The bureau’s annual Reported Crimes in the Nation Statistics report reflects a 4.5% year-on-year decrease in all violent crime nationally in 2024, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter falling 14.5% from the 2023 figure. Reported rapes were down 5.2% from the year before, while aggravated assaults and robberies declined 3% and 8.9% respectively. The figures belie Trump’s oft-repeated fear-mongering during the election campaign that “soft-on-crime” Democrats had fueled surging crime rates, particularly in major cities under their control. In May 2024, for example, Trump told reporters attending his hush-money trial in Manhattan that New York prosecutors were fixated on his prosecution while “people are being mugged and killed outside ... [I’ve] never seen anything like it in my life”. Yet the FBI report shows that murders in cities with more than 1 million residents declined by 19.1%, the highest percentage of any category of crime, while rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults showed drops of between 1% and 9.8%. “The nation’s murder rate for 2024 was down 26% from 2020’s figure and roughly even, slightly lower actually, relative to where it stood pre-pandemic,” crime analyst Jeff Asher said on his Substack channel Jeff-alytics. “The nation’s reported violent and property crime rates stood at the lowest levels since the 1960s in 2024.” Asher injected a note of caution by pointing out that the FBI had added the prefix “reported” to the publication’s former title Crimes in the Nation to reflect the fact that the figures were compiled by voluntary submissions from more than 16,000 state, county, city, university and college, and tribal law enforcement agencies. “Not every crime is reported to law enforcement and not every agency reports crime to the FBI every year,” he said. But, he added: “The 2024 data adds confidence that 2025 will feature the lowest murder rate ever recorded. The odds have gone from ‘plausible’ to ‘more likely than not’.” Overall, the FBI recorded more than 14m criminal offenses nationally in 2024. Reported data, the bureau said, showed that a violent crime occurred, on average, every 25.9 seconds, with a murder every 31.1 minutes and a rape every 4.1 minutes. The report comprises five sections, including an analysis of the frequency of hate crimes, and the number of assaults or killings of law enforcement officers. In the former category, data covering 95.1% of the US population showed 11,679 criminal incidents, and 13,683 related offenses motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender or gender identity, small drops from the respective 2023 figures of 11,862 and 13,829. The Arab American Institute cast doubt on the accuracy of the reporting in a statement. “Although some bias categories experienced slight declines from last year’s record highs, these numbers should be interpreted cautiously,” Maya Berry, the group’s executive director, said. “From the chronic underreporting problem to discrepancies in hate crime reporting between communities, to the deeply troubling moves to politicize hate crime data collection, we must understand this data serves as not only a stark reminder of the challenges we face, but a call to action. It underscores the urgent need for civil rights protections that are robust, inclusive, and enforced.” A dark spot on the report was data showing that 64 law enforcement officers had been killed “feloniously” during 2024 in the line of duty, with firearms used in 46 of the deaths. Additionally, 43 more officers died in accidents over the year, most in vehicle-related incidents. The number of law enforcement personnel who reported they had been assaulted in 2024 rose to 85,730, a 10-year high. The 2025 figure to be published next year is expected to rise significantly to reflect homeland security department (DHS) claims that assaults on immigration and customs enforcement agency (Ice) officers have risen 830% since Trump’s second term began in January. Prosecutors, however, have dropped or refused to pursue charges against numerous individuals citing false and misleading reports by immigration officers and video footage showing those accused of assaults were actually the victims.",

The report indicates a 4.5% decline across all categories of violence compared to the previous year, marking the lowest level of violent crime since the 1960s.",
      "ai_content": "In a striking revelation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's latest statistics have debunked former President Donald Trump's assertions regarding rampant criminal activity during Joe Biden's presidency. According to the FBI's 'Reported Crimes in the Nation' report, there has been a substantial reduction in violent crimes throughout the United States in 2024, which stands in stark contrast to the narrative promoted by Mr. Trump prior to his electoral win in 2024.\nThe comprehensive analysis provided by the FBI demonstrates a nationwide decrease in various forms of violent offenses. Notably, the overall violent crime rate experienced a downturn of 4.5% when juxtaposed against the preceding year's metrics. This downward trend extends across multiple facets of criminal behavior; specifically, homicide saw a precipitous fall of 14.5%, rape incidents receded by 5.2%, aggravated assault cases diminished by 3%, and robbery occurrences contracted by 8.9%.\nThese findings directly counteract Mr. Trump's frequent warnings concerning what he termed a 'soft-on-crime' stance adopted by Democratic administrations, especially within urban centers they governed. His rhetoric often painted a grim picture of escalating lawlessness, yet these recent numbers tell a different story—one of safety and declining crime rates.\nJeff Asher, a noted crime analyst, highlighted that the nation's murder rate for 2024 plummeted by 26% from its peak in 2020, situating itself near historical lows reminiscent of times predating the COVID-19 pandemic. Cities housing populations exceeding one million inhabitants witnessed the most pronounced reductions, with murder rates dropping by an astonishing 19.1%. Other serious crimes such as rape also followed suit, albeit with smaller declines ranging from just 1% to nearly 10%.\nThis evidence-based refutation serves as a critical reminder that public discourse around crime policy and perception requires grounding in empirical data rather than political posturing.",

Reported rapes were down 5.2% from the year before, while aggravated assaults and robberies declined 3% and 8.9% respectively. The figures belie Trump’s oft-repeated fear-mongering during the election campaign that “soft-on-crime” Democrats had fueled surging crime rates, particularly in major cities under their control. In May 2024, for example, Trump told reporters attending his hush-money trial in Manhattan that New York prosecutors were fixated on his prosecution while “people are being mugged and killed outside ... [I’ve] never seen anything like it in my life”. Yet the FBI report shows that murders in cities with more than 1 million residents declined by 19.1%, the highest percentage of any category of crime, while rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults showed drops of between 1% and 9.8%. “The nation’s murder rate for 2024 was down 26% from 2020’s figure and roughly even, slightly lower actually, relative to where it stood pre-pandemic,” crime analyst Jeff Asher said on his Substack channel Jeff-alytics. “The nation’s reported violent and property crime rates stood at the lowest levels since the 1960s in 2024.” Asher injected a note of caution by pointing out that the FBI had added the prefix “reported” to the publication’s former title Crimes in the Nation to reflect the fact that the figures were compiled by voluntary submissions from more than 16,000 state, county, city, university and college, and tribal law enforcement agencies. “Not every crime is reported to law enforcement and not every agency reports crime to the FBI every year,” he said. But, he added: “The 2024 data adds confidence that 2025 will feature the lowest murder rate ever recorded. The odds have gone from ‘plausible’ to ‘more likely than not’.” Overall, the FBI recorded more than 14m criminal offenses nationally in 2024. Reported data, the bureau said, showed that a violent crime occurred, on average, every 25.9 seconds, with a murder every 31.1 minutes and a rape every 4.1 minutes. The report comprises five sections, including an analysis of the frequency of hate crimes, and the number of assaults or killings of law enforcement officers. In the former category, data covering 95.1% of the US population showed 11,679 criminal incidents, and 13,683 related offenses motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender or gender identity, small drops from the respective 2023 figures of 11,862 and 13,829. The Arab American Institute cast doubt on the accuracy of the reporting in a statement. “Although some bias categories experienced slight declines from last year’s record highs, these numbers should be interpreted cautiously,” Maya Berry, the group’s executive director, said. “From the chronic underreporting problem to discrepancies in hate crime reporting between communities, to the deeply troubling moves to politicize hate crime data collection, we must understand this data serves as not only a stark reminder of the challenges we face, but a call to action. It underscores the urgent need for civil rights protections that are robust, inclusive, and enforced.” A dark spot on the report was data showing that 64 law enforcement officers had been killed “feloniously” during 2024 in the line of duty, with firearms used in 46 of the deaths. Additionally, 43 more officers died in accidents over the year, most in vehicle-related incidents. The number of law enforcement personnel who reported they had been assaulted in 2024 rose to 85,730, a 10-year high. The 2025 figure to be published next year is expected to rise significantly to reflect homeland security department (DHS) claims that assaults on immigration and customs enforcement agency (Ice) officers have risen 830% since Trump’s second term began in January. Prosecutors, however, have dropped or refused to pursue charges against numerous individuals citing false and misleading reports by immigration officers and video footage showing those accused of assaults were actually the victims.",

Violent crime reached its lowest level since the 1960s, debunking fears of 'soft-on-crime' policies leading to increased urban criminal activity.",
      "ai_content": "In stark contrast to President Trump's assertions made throughout his tenure regarding rampant crime waves attributed to Democratic governance, new statistics unveiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) paint a different picture of American safety. According to the FBI's latest Reported Crimes in the Nation Statistics, there has been a notable decline in violent offenses across the United States, marking a 4.5% reduction nationwide in 2024 when juxtaposed against previous years.\nThis revelation comes amidst political rhetoric suggesting that the Biden administration oversaw unprecedented spikes in heinous acts such as homicides and sexual assaults. However, these allegations have now been thoroughly discredited by empirical evidence indicating that America experienced one of its safest periods within the concluding phase of President Joe Biden's term.\nThe comprehensive report details declines across various categories of crime; specifically, homicide and non-negligent manslaughter saw a substantial fall of 14.5% from the preceding year's numbers. Rape incidents also receded marginally by 5.2%, whereas other forms of assault—aggravated and robbery—witnessed decreases ranging from 3% to 8.9%.\nThese findings directly counteract narratives propagated by then-President Trump, who frequently warned voters of escalating crime rates purportedly linked to lenient judicial approaches towards criminals—a sentiment he echoed during his recent legal proceedings in Manhattan concerning alleged financial misconduct.\nMoreover, the FBI report highlights that metropolitan areas housing populations exceeding one million inhabitants recorded the most pronounced dip in murder cases, plunging by 19.1%. This trend underscores a broader pattern wherein violent crimes plummeted to historic lows reminiscent of those observed back in the 1960s.\nJeff Asher, a noted crime analyst featured on his Substack platform Jeff-alytics, cautiously notes that the inclusion of the word 'reported' alongside previously used titles signifies that these figures stem from self-reported data submitted voluntarily by numerous local authorities including states, counties, municipalities, educational institutions, and Native American tribes.\nAsher emphasizes that despite these encouraging trends, it's important to recognize that not all criminal activities come to light through official channels nor do they always reach police databases.",

      "description": "Separately selected officials appear to have more leeway when it comes to personnel-related executive orders, like one about in-person work.",
      "content": "From left: Indiana Gov. Mike Braun and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith appear at a rally in Greenwood on Oct. 26, 2024. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle) Indiana Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, who is is six months into a convention-arranged political marriage with Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, is complying with certain executive orders because he wants to — not because he has to. The interpretation comes after Beckwith’s Statehouse executive office has been repeatedly closed to the public during business hours in recent weeks, even though Braun directed state agencies to return full-time employees to in-person work by July 1. Both offices agree that agencies Beckwith oversees — the Indiana State Department of Agriculture and the Office of Community and Rural Affairs — are bound by the order. But the lieutenant governor himself is among just six separately selected statewide officeholders detailed in Indiana’s constitution. Beckwith is the second in command in the executive branch but also presides over the Indiana Senate. This means that some employees under the lieutenant governor’s authority could have to follow executive orders while others wouldn’t. Beckwith Spokesman James Kehoe maintains that Beckwith’s office has chosen to follow the in-office order, including his executive and business teams. Beckwith “ believes in the spirit” of the order, so the office is “voluntarily complying,” Kehoe wrote. He cited two Statehouse attorneys who “both gave us the legal opinion” that the office “isn’t bound by” the directive. Braun’s office indicated separately elected and nominated officials can opt into certain executive orders. “ We are setting a policy and we are leading,” Braun’s General Counsel Patrick Price said. “And you know, if other state elected officials want to follow the governor’s lead, we ... welcome them to do that.” The running mates began their new roles in January. Their partnership has included disagreements over policy and public remarks . Republican delegates narrowly selected Beckwith as the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor in a surprising vote at a party convention last June, rebuffing Braun’s handpicked choice for the role . Representatives for the two leaders had slightly differing explanations for whether executive orders do or don’t apply. Braun’s office pointed to a chapter of Indiana Code about the state’s civil service system, which specifically exempts the governor, lieutenant governor and four other statewide elected officials from such personnel requirements. “If you’re separately elected or separately nominated, your accountability is to the voters, not the governor,” Price said. Budget-related orders would still apply to everyone, however. Beckwith’s office indicated it uses a case-by-case approach. CONTACT US “ Since all Executive Orders are different, you’d need to ask about each specifically for me to address this,” Kehoe said. He confirmed the office has sought an opinion — essentially, legal advice — from the Office of Attorney General, “but we have not heard back.” Indiana’s governor and lieutenant governor have run on the same ticket since the 1976 elections, when a constitutional amendment went into effect. Until then, the two were separately elected. Voters approved the change in a 56%-44% referendum two years prior. Proponents argued the amendment would boost cooperation between the state’s two top officeholders because they’d at least belong to the same party, according to a 1974 edition of the Nappanee Advance-News. Opponents held that the dual ticket would limit voter options and reduce the lieutenant governor to a “rubber stamp” of the governor’s perspective. Paul Helmke, a professor at Indiana University Bloomington’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said it’s likely the first time “we’ve had that kind of conflict” since the amendment took effect. Helmke served three terms as the Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, leaving office in 2000. He led the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence for five years and joined IU’s faculty in 2013. “They’ve always been a team,” he said of the two roles. “But this one, I mean, we knew was going to be different, just going back to the convention.” Party insiders pick the lieutenant governor nominee in at springtime conventions. They typically — but don’t always — fall in line with the preference of the gubernatorial nominee, who is chosen by primary election voters. That difference in selection mechanisms is why “there’s always been a potential for a split between the two,” Helmke said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

Micah Beckwith's office will voluntarily comply with certain executive orders regarding in-person work despite being able to choose otherwise due to its unique constitutional position. While Governor Mike Braun insists that separate officials may decide which orders they wish to follow, Beckwith cites legal advice supporting non-compliance with specific directives.",
      "ai_content": "In a move reflecting autonomy granted by Indiana's constitution, Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith announced that his office would 'voluntarily' adhere to certain executive orders concerning mandatory in-person work, diverging from the stance taken by Governor Mike Braun's administration. Despite Braun directing state agencies to resume full-time in-person operations by July 1, Beckwith's Statehouse executive office remained inaccessible to the public during regular business hours—a decision seemingly influenced by personal conviction rather than compulsion.\nBeckwith, whose tenure commenced alongside Braun in January following their election as running mates, finds himself uniquely positioned within Indiana's government structure. As the state's second-in-command yet head of the Indiana Senate, he exercises control over several departments, such as the Indiana State Department of Agriculture and the Office of Community and Rural Affairs—entities obligated to obey Braun's executive mandates.\nThe divergence between the two administrations was highlighted when representatives from each office provided contrasting interpretations of the governor's ability to enforce compliance across different branches of state governance. Braun's General Counsel, Patrick Price, emphasized a welcoming approach towards other elected officials choosing to align with the governor's policies, whereas Beckwith relied upon legal counsel affirming his office's discretion against particular orders.\nThis development follows ongoing tensions between Braun and Beckwith, stemming from policy disputes and public statements since their joint inauguration. Notably, Beckwith secured his vice governorship through a narrow victory at a Republican Party convention earlier this year, challenging Braun's preferred candidate selection. The current standoff underscores the complexities inherent in shared leadership roles and raises questions about the extent of gubernatorial influence over independently appointed officials.",

      "content": "The Tennessee Titans have a new special teams unit in place for the upcoming season. Here's a look at the team's special teams depth chart for their preseason opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Titans elected not to bring in any competition for the veteran special teams unit. Slye played with the New England Patriots in 2024 while Hekker was with the Carolina Panthers. Jackson holds a slight lead on the kick return job, but he will have to showcase his best. Dike is pretty much a lock to make the team as a fourth-round rookie and if he does a decent enough job in the role, the Titans could just kill two birds with one stone by making him the return man. Proche is in a similar boat with Jackson where he may be the team's best option, but if Dike is already making the team as a backup wide receiver, the Titans may also turn to him as a return specialist. While Dike is listed as the backup for both kickoffs and punts, he might be the favorite to win those jobs out of training camp. Return specialists are hardly used for specific people anymore. Instead, these jobs go to backups at either the running back, wide receiver or cornerback positions. Dike was chosen by the Titans with the first pick in the fourth round of the NFL Draft this spring, so the team will keep him on the roster no matter what. Therefore, he just needs to prove competent in those roles to secure that spot. Proche or Jackson could have an excellent training camp, snag a backup wide receiver spot and a return role, but Dike has the inside track considering his status as an earlier selection from this year's draft class. Kickoff between the Titans and Buccaneers is scheduled for Saturday at 7:30 p.m. ET inside Raymond James Stadium.

Jackson currently leads the charge for kick returns, yet it remains uncertain whether he can maintain this position throughout training camp. On the other hand, Dike's early selection in the fourth round of the NFL Draft secures his presence on the roster; however, he faces stiff competition for starting roles such as kicker and punter.\nDike's versatility extends beyond traditional kicking duties—he could potentially serve as a return specialist given his background as a wide receiver. This dual-threat capability aligns well with modern football strategies, which often favor versatile players capable of fulfilling multiple roles based on performance rather than predetermined assignments.\nProche shares similarities with Jackson regarding his prospects for becoming a primary player in special teams tasks like kick returns. However, Dike’s established standing gives him an edge in securing these coveted positions.\nAs the Titans gear up for their matchup with the Buccaneers, fans eagerly anticipate how these emerging talents will perform under pressure.

      "content": "As we enter peak hurricane season, it’s important to realize how storm season has been saturated with “woke” ideology.Hurricanes used to be known only by the time and places they occurred, such as the “Great Miami Hurricane of 1926.”In World War II, Navy and Air Force meteorologists began tracking tropical storms by using their girlfriends’ and wives’ names, for easy reference. Then the military would name storms after its phonetic alphabet — Able, Baker, Charlie — but that was replaced by a system that was less confusing and easier to remember.In 1954, the weather bureau chose women’s names as the standard. That was the year of Alice, Barbara and Carol. More memorable storms followed: Camille, Donna, Carla.In 1979, the National Weather Service and World Meteorological Organization decided to evenly split women’s and men’s names, using six groups of 26 names, rotating annually.We need to go back to just women’s names. Just as we renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, it’s time to get rid of “woke” ideology and call things in ways that made America great.Fred Fejes, Pompano BeachOur differences matterPolitical differences are part of what makes America. Fortunately, we’re still a place where we can freely share opinions and beliefs. Differences are important, but allowing them to mean everything can cause problems with those we love — even family and friends.People once had lots to discuss that did not include politics. You mostly didn’t know or care which party a person belonged to. If you shun those who disagree with you, you become susceptible to fear and misinformation, further dividing us.Keeping your mind open to other views is not a betrayal of our principles — it affirms them. Lies and misinformation divide us, discourage civic participation, erode trust in the rule of law and justify policies that can weaken our democracy.I will continue to question and fact-check what I read and hear, though I find it increasingly challenging to find the truth. I will continue to lead with love and not let politics become my personality.Rosemary Blumberg, PlantationSavor the joy. It won’t lastAs I reach my declining years, I’m amazed at not being morbid, frightened or scornful about the past. In an extended life, memories come and go in microbursts. As friends gather, socialization nurtures life. Loneliness can kill.At a funeral, no one likes to hear bad things of the deceased (at least publicly). In hushed tones, wives swap stories elevating or demonizing the deceased.Yet it’s life we must consider foremost. After all, within days or weeks of our passing, little will be said or remembered of most of us. Our reality is that which is of the moment.So just say the heck with it, and find joy in what time remains.Ed Horn, Delray BeachDon’t demonize RepublicansRep.

Marco Rubio was elected in Florida, despite falling into the “brown people” category of Hispanics whom Republicans supposedly hate.But why let the facts get in the way of demonizing an entire group of people?

The writer believes this change reflects 'woke' ideology and advocates for traditional naming conventions reminiscent of past practices during WWII and post-WWII.",
      "ai_content": "The tradition of naming hurricanes has come under scrutiny from readers concerned about contemporary cultural trends. Fred Fejes, writing from Pompano Beach, expresses his disapproval of the current method of alternating between male and female names for hurricanes, viewing it as emblematic of broader societal shifts towards 'woke' ideologies. He reminisces about earlier times when hurricanes were simply identified by their occurrence dates and locations, such as the 'Great Miami Hurricane of 1926.' During World War II, naval and air force meteorologists named storms after their girlfriends' and wives' names for ease of communication before switching to the phonetic alphabet—Able, Baker, Charlie—and eventually settling on a more straightforward approach.\nIn 1954, the decision was made to use solely women's names—a choice exemplified by storms like Alice, Barbara, and Carol—as per the guidelines set forth by the National Weather Service and the World Meteorological Organization. This convention continued until 1979 when these organizations agreed upon a gender-balanced rotation among 26 names each year.\nFejes calls for a reversion to the original practice of using only women's names for hurricanes, drawing parallels to historical changes in terminology, such as renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. He contends that reverting to this simpler nomenclature could help dispel some aspects of modern political divisiveness. In contrast, Rosemary Blumberg from Plantation emphasizes the importance of maintaining openness to diverse viewpoints rather than succumbing to polarization. She stresses that engaging with differing perspectives does not compromise one's values; instead, it strengthens democratic ideals.\nWhile Fejes's letter focuses on the symbolic implications of hurricane naming conventions within American culture, Blumberg highlights the practical benefits of dialogue across ideological divides. Both letters reflect ongoing debates around identity politics and public discourse in America's evolving social landscape.",

We define net loss ratio expressed as a percentage, as the ratio of the net losses and loss adjustment expenses, to the net earned premium. We define adjusted net income (loss), a Non-GAAP financial measure, as net income excluding the impact of certain items that may not be indicative of underlying business trends, operating results, or future outlook, net of tax impact. We calculate the tax impact only on adjustments which would be included in calculating our income tax expense using the estimated tax rate at which the company received a deduction for these adjustments. We define adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure, as net loss attributable to Hippo excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, net investment income, restructuring charges, impairment expense, gains and losses on sales of business, other non-cash fair market value adjustments, contingent consideration for one of our acquisitions, and other transactions, which may include certain legal fees and settlement costs, that we consider to be unique in nature. We exclude these items from Adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider them to be directly attributable to our underlying operating performance. These Non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP counterpart is included in the shareholder letter referenced above.

The company highlighted a $100 million capital infusion through a strategic partnership, along with the launch of two new commercial and casualty programs.",
      "ai_content": "In San Jose, California, Hippo Inc. (NYSE:HIPO), known for its technology-driven approach to home insurance solutions, released their financial outcomes for the period ending June 30, 2025. Under the leadership of President and CEO Rick McCathron, Hippo disclosed substantial progress across various metrics during what was described as 'another strong quarter.' Notably, the firm experienced a remarkable surge in revenues—up by 31 percent year-over-year—to reach $117 million. This uptick was attributed primarily to an expansion in gross written premiums amounting to $299 million—a 16 percent rise from the previous year—and enhanced premium retention rates.\nThe announcement came alongside the introduction of two innovative commercial and casualty offerings within Hippo's hybrid fronting framework, aimed at diversifying product lines and bolstering profit margins. A pivotal moment in Hippo's fiscal narrative occurred when it achieved a milestone previously unheld since inception—the generation of positive net income derived directly from operating endeavors. This shift towards profitability was underpinned by several factors, such as improved underwriting practices, effective rate adjustments, optimized claim handling processes, and advantageous reserve movements.\nFurther dissecting the numbers reveals a dramatic turnaround in the company's net loss ratio—from a staggering 55 percent down to just below half at 47 percent year-over-year. Such a transformation speaks volumes about Hippo's commitment to refining its business model and enhancing overall efficiency. Additionally, fixed expenses related to sales & marketing, technological development and maintenance, and general administration saw a decline of approximately $6 million despite rising revenue streams, indicating sustained cost management success.\nAs part of its forward-looking strategy, Hippo has secured a robust $100 million investment via a newly forged alliance designed to propel further growth and fortify its financial standing. For those seeking comprehensive insights into Hippo's performance throughout 2025—including detailed quarterly breakdowns and projections—detailed reports are accessible through the investor relations portal on their official website.\nFor additional context and analysis regarding Hippo's latest achievements and future outlook, interested parties may visit Benzinga.com.",
